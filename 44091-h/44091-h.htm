<h3><a name="I" id="I">CHAPTER I</a></h3>

<p class="center">EUCHARIS</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Then, in the violet forest, all a-bourgeon, Eucharis
said to me: "It is Spring."</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arthur Rimbaud.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the dim purple bloom of a suspended
spring, a green rhythm ran from larch to
thorn, from lime to sycamore; spread from
meadow to meadow, from copse to copse,
from hedgerow to hedgerow. The blackthorn
had already snowed upon the nettle-garths.
In the obvious nests among the
bare boughs of ash and beech the eggs of the
blackbird were blue-green as the sky that
March had bequeathed to April. For days
past, when the breath of the equinox had
surged out of the west, the missel-thrushes
had bugled from the wind-swayed topmost
branches of the tallest elms. Everywhere the
green rhythm ran.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>In every leaf that had uncurled there was a
delicate bloom, that which is upon all things in
the first hours of life. The spires of the grass
were washed in a green, dewy light. Out of
the brown earth a myriad living things thrust
tiny green shafts, arrow-heads, bulbs, spheres,
clusters. Along the pregnant soil keener ears
than ours would have heard the stir of new
life, the innumerous whisper of the bursting
seed; and, in the wind itself, shepherding the
shadow-chased sunbeams, the voice of that
vernal gladness which has been man's clarion
since Time began.</p>

<p>Day by day the wind-wings lifted a more
multitudinous whisper from the woodlands.
The deep hyperborean note, from the invisible
ocean of air, was still audible: within the
concourse of bare boughs which lifted against
it, that surging voice could not but have an
echo of its wintry roar. In the sun-havens,
however, along the southerly copses, in
daisied garths of orchard-trees, amid the
flowering currant and guelder and lilac bushes
in quiet places where the hives were all
a-murmur, the wind already sang its lilt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
spring. From dawn till noon, from an hour
before sundown till the breaking foam along
the wild cherry flushed fugitively because of
the crimson glow out of the west, there was
a ceaseless chittering of birds. The starlings
and the sparrows enjoyed the commune
of the homestead; the larks and fieldfares
and green and yellow linnets congregated in
the meadows, where, too, the wild bee already
roved. Among the brown ridgy fallows
there was a constant flutter of black,
white-gleaming, and silver-gray wings, where
the stalking rooks, the jerking pewets, and the
wary, uncertain gulls from the neighboring
sea, feasted tirelessly from the teeming earth.
Often, too, the wind-hover, that harbinger
of the season of the young broods, quivered
his curved wings in his arrested flight, while
his lance-like gaze penetrated the whins,
beneath which a new-born rabbit crawled, or
discerned in the tangle of a grassy tuft the
brown, watchful eyes of a nesting quail.</p>

<p>In the remoter woodlands the three foresters
of April could be heard: the woodpecker
tapping on the gnarled boles of the oaks;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the wild-dove calling in low, crooning monotones
to his silent mate; the cuckoo tolling
his infrequent peals from skyey belfries built
of sun and mist.</p>

<p>In the fields, where the thorns were green
as rivulets of melted snow and the grass had
the bloom of emerald, and the leaves of
docken, clover, cinquefoil, sorrel, and a thousand
plants and flowers, were wave-green, the
ewes lay, idly watching with their luminous
amber eyes the frisking and leaping of the
close-curled, tuft-tailed, woolly-legged lambs.
In corners of the hedgerows, and in hollows
in the rolling meadows, the primrose, the celandine,
the buttercup, the dandelion, and the
daffodil spilled little eddies of the sun-flood
which overbrimmed them with light. All day
long the rapture of the larks filled the blue
air with vanishing spirals of music, swift and
passionate in the ascent, repetitive and less
piercing in the narrowing downward gyres.
From every whin the poignant, monotonous
note of the yellow-hammer reëchoed. Each
pastoral hedge was alive with robins, chaffinches,
and the dusky shadows of the wild-mice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
darting here and there among the greening
boughs.</p>

<p>Whenever this green fire is come upon
the earth, the swift contagion spreads to the
human heart. What the seedlings feel in the
brown mould, what the sap feels in the trees,
what the blood feels in every creature from
the newt in the pool to the nesting bird&mdash;so
feels the strange, remembering ichor that
runs its red tides through human hearts and
brains. Spring has its subtler magic for us,
because of the dim mysteries of unremembering
remembrance and of the vague radiances
of hope. Something in us sings an ascendant
song, and we expect, we know not what;
something in us sings a decrescent song, and
we realize vaguely the stirring of immemorial
memories.</p>

<p>There is none who will admit that spring
is fairer elsewhere than in his own land.
But there are regions where the season
is so hauntingly beautiful that it would
seem as though Angus Ogue knew them
for his chosen resting-places in his green
journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Angus Og, Angus MacGreine, Angus the
Ever Youthful, the Son of the Sun, a fair
god he indeed, golden-haired and wonderful
as Apollo Chrusokomes. Some say that
he is Love; some, that he is Spring; some,
even, that in him, Thanatos, the Hellenic
Celt that was his far-off kin, is reincarnate.
But why seek riddles in flowing water?
It may well be that Angus Ogue is Love,
and Spring, and Death. The elemental gods
are ever triune; and in the human heart,
in whose lost Eden an ancient tree of
knowledge grows wherefrom the mind has
not yet gathered more than a few windfalls,
it is surely sooth that Death and Love are
oftentimes one and the same, and that
they love to come to us in the apparel of
Spring.</p>

<p>Sure, indeed, Angus Ogue is a name above
all sweet to lovers, for is he not the god&mdash;the
fair youth of the Tuatha-de-Danann, the
Ancient People, with us still, though for ages
seen of us no more&mdash;from the meeting of
whose lips are born white birds, which fly
abroad and nest in lovers' hearts till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
moment come when, on the yearning lips of
love, their invisible wings shall become kisses
again?</p>

<p>Then, too, there is the old legend that
Angus goes to and fro upon the world, a
weaver of rainbows. He follows the spring,
or is its herald. Often his rainbows are
seen in the heavens; often in the rapt gaze
of love. We have all perceived them in
the eyes of children, and some of us have
discerned them in the hearts of sorrowful
women and in the dim brains of the old.
Ah! for sure, if Angus Og be the lovely
Weaver of Hope he is deathless comrade of
the spring, and we may well pray to him to
let his green fire move in our veins, whether
he be but the Eternal Youth of the World,
or be also Love, whose soul is youth, or
even though he be likewise Death himself,
Death to whom Love was wedded long,
long ago.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But nowhere was spring more lovely, nowhere
was the green fire of life so quick with
impulsive ardors, as, one year of the years, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
a seaward region to the north of the ancient
forest of Broceliande, in what of old was
Armorica and now is Brittany.</p>

<p>Here spring often comes late, but ever
lingers long. Here, too, in the dim green
avenues of the oak-woods of Kerival, the
nightingales reach their uttermost western
flight. Never has the shepherd, tending
his scant flock on the upland pastures of
Finistère, nor the fisherman lying a-dream
amid the sandy thickets of Ushant, heard
that quaint music&mdash;that primeval and
ever young song of the passionate heart
which Augustine might well have had in
mind when he exclaimed "Sero te amavi,
Pulchritudo, tam antiqua et tam nova,
sero te amavi." But, each April, in the
woods of Kerival, the nightingales congregate
from afar, and through May their songs
make the forest like a sanctuary filled with
choristers swinging incense of a delicate
music.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful region, that which lies
betwixt Ploumaliou on the east and Kerloek
on the west; the oldest, remotest part of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
ancient, remote land. Here the few hamlets
and fewer scattered villages are, even in externals,
the same as they were a hundred or
three hundred years ago. In essentials, there
is no difference since St. Hervé or St. Ronan
preached the new faith, or indeed since Ahès
the Pale rode through the forest aisles in the
moonlight and heard the Nains chanting, or
since King Gradlon raced his horse against
the foam when his daughter let the sea in
upon the fair city of Ys. The good <i>curés</i>
preach the religion of Christ and of Mary to
the peasants; but in the minds of most of
these there lingers much of the bygone faith
that reared the menhirs. Few indeed there
are in whose ears is never an echo of the old
haunted world, when every wood and stream,
every barren moor and granite wilderness,
every sea-pasture and creek and bay had its
particular presence, its spirit of good or ill,
its menace, its perilous enchantment. The
eyes of the peasants by these shores, these
moors, these windy hill-slopes of the south,
are not fixed only on the meal-chest and the
fallow-field, or, on fête-days, upon the crucifix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in the little church; but often dwell upon
a past time, more sacred now than ever in this
bitter relinquishing age. On the lips of many
may be heard lines from that sad folk-song,
"Ann Amzer Dremenet" (In the Long Ago):</p>

<p>Old sayings they have, too; who knows how
old? The charcoal-burner in the woods above
Kerloek will still shudder at the thought of
death on the bleak, open moor, because of the
carrion-crow that awaits his sightless eyes, the
fox that will tear his heart out, and the toad
that will swallow his soul. Long, long ago
Gwenc'hlan the Bard sang thus of his foe and
the foes of his people, when every battle field
was a pasture for the birds and beasts of prey,
and when the Spirit of Evil lurked near every
corpse in the guise of a toad. And still the
shrimper, in the sands beyond Ploumaliou, will
cry out against the predatory sea fowl <i>A gas
ar Gall&mdash;a gas ar Gall!</i> (Chase the Franks!)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and not know that, ages ago, this cry went
up from the greatest of Breton kings, when
Nomenoë drove the Frankish invaders beyond
the Oust and the Vilaine, and lighted their
flight by the flames of Nantes and Rennes.</p>

<p>Near the northern frontier of the remotest
part of this ancient region, the Manor of
Kerival was the light-house of its forest vicinage.
It was and is surrounded by woods, for
the most part of oak and chestnut and beech.
Therein are trees of an age so great that they
may have sheltered the flight of Jud Mael,
when Ahès chased him on her white stallion
from glade to glade, and one so venerably old
that its roots may have been soaked in the
blood of their child Judik, whom she forced
her betrayer to slay with the sword before she
thrust a dagger into his heart. Northward of
the manor, however, the forest is wholly of
melancholy spruce, of larch and pine. The
pines extend in a desolate disarray to the
interminable dunes, beyond which the Breton
sea lifts its gray wave against a gray horizon.
On that shore there are few rocks,
though here and there fang-like reefs rise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ready to tear and devour any boat hurled
upon them at full tide in days of storm. At
Kerival Haven, too, there is a wilderness of
granite rock; a mass of pinnacles, buttresses,
and inchoate confusion, ending in long, smooth
ledges of black basalt, these forever washed
by the green flow of the tides.</p>

<p>None of the peasants knew the age of the
House of Kerival, or how long the Kerival
family had been there. Old Yann Hénan, the
blind brother of the white-haired <i>curé</i>, Père
Alain, who was the oldest man in all the
countryside, was wont to say that Kerival
woods had been green before ever there was a
house on the banks of the Seine, and that a
Kerival had been lord of the land before ever
there was a king of France. All believed this,
except Père Alain, and even he dissented only
when Yann spoke of the seigneur's ancestor
as the Marquis of Kerival; for, as he explained,
there were no marquises in those far-off
days. But this went for nothing; for,
unfortunately, Père Alain had once in his
youth preached against the popular belief in
Korrigans and Nains, and had said that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
supernatural beings did not exist, or at any
rate were never seen of man. How, then,
could much credence be placed on the testimony
of a man who could be so prejudiced?
Yann had but to sing a familiar snatch from
the old ballad of "Aotru Nann Hag ar Gorrigan"&mdash;the
fragment beginning</p>

<p>When Yann sang this, or told for the hundredth
time the familiar story of how Paskou-Hir
the tailor was treated by the Nains when
he sought to rifle the hidden treasure in the
grotto, every one knew that he spoke what
was authentic, what was true. As for Père
Alain&mdash;well, priests are told to say many things
by the good, wise Holy Father, who rules the
world so well but has never been in Brittany,
and so cannot know all that happens there,
and has happened from time immemorial.
Then, again, was there not the evidence of
the alien, the strange, quiet man called Yann
the Dumb, because of his silence at most times&mdash;him
that was the servitor-in-chief to the
Lady Lois, the beautiful paralyzed wife of the
Marquis of Kerival, and that came from the far
north, where the kindred of the Armorican
race dwell among the misty isles and rainy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
hills of Scotland? Indeed Yann had been
heard to say that he would sooner disbelieve
in the Pope himself than in the kelpie, for in
his own land he had himself heard her devilish
music luring him across a lonely moor, and
he had known a man who had gone fey because
he had seen the face of a kelpie in a hill-tarn.</p>

<p>In the time of the greening, even the Korrigans
are unseen of walkers in the dusk.
They are busy then, some say, winding the
white into the green bulbs of the water-lilies,
or tinting the wings within the chrysalis of the
water-fly, or weaving the bright skins for the
newts; but however this may be, the season
of the green flood over the brown earth is not
that wherein man may fear them.</p>

<p>No fear of Korrigan or Nain, or any other
woodland creature or haunter of pool or
stream, disturbed two who walked in the
green-gloom of a deep avenue in the midst
of the forest beyond the Manor of Kerival.
They were young, and there was green fire in
their hearts; for they moved slow, hand claspt
in hand, and with their eyes dwelling often on
the face of each other. And whenever Ynys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
de Kerival looked at her cousin Alan she
thought him the fairest and comeliest of the
sons of men; and whenever Alan turned the
longing of his eyes upon Ynys he wondered if
anywhere upon the green earth moved aught
so sweet and winsome, if anywhere in the
green world was another woman so beautiful
in body, mind, and spirit, as Ynys&mdash;Ynys the
Dark, as the peasants called her, though Ynys
of the dusky hair and the hazel-green eyes
would have been truer of her whom Alan de
Kerival loved. Of a truth, she was fair to
see. Tall she was, and lithe; in her slim,
svelt body there was something of the swift
movement of the hill-deer, something of the
agile abandon of the leopard. She was of that
small clan, the true daughters of the sun.
Her tanned face and hands showed that she
loved the open air, though indeed her every
movement proved this. The sun-life was
even in that shadowy hair of hers, which had
a sheen of living light wrought into its
fragrant dusk; it was in her large, deep, translucent
eyes, of a soft, dewy twilight-gray
often filled with green light, as of the forest-aisles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
or as the heart of a sea-wave as it
billows over sunlit sand; it was in the heart
and in the brain of this daughter of an ancient
race&mdash;and the nostalgia of the green world
was hers. For in her veins ran the blood
not only of her Armorican ancestors but of
another Celtic strain, that of the Gael of the
Isles, Through her mother, Lois Macdonald,
of the remote south isles of the Outer
Hebrides, the daughter of a line as ancient
as that of Tristran de Kerival, she inherited
even more than her share of the gloom, the
mystery, the sea-passion, the vivid oneness
with nature which have disclosed to so many
of her fellow-Celts secret sources of peace.</p>

<p>Everywhere in that region the peasant
poets sang of Ynys the Dark or of her sister
Annaik. They were the two beautiful women
of the world, there. But, walking in the
fragrant green-gloom of the beeches, Alan
smiled when he thought of Annaik, for all her
milk-white skin and her wonderful tawny hair,
for all her strange, shadowy amber-brown
eyes&mdash;eyes often like dark hill-crystals aflame
with stormy light. She was beautiful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
tall too, and with an even wilder grace than
Ynys; yet&mdash;there was but one woman in the
world, but one Dream, and her name was
Ynys.</p>

<p>It was then that he remembered the line of
the unfortunate boy-poet of the Paris that has
not forgotten him; and looking at Ynys, who
seemed to him the very spirit of the green life
all around him, muttered: "Then in the
violet forest, all a-bourgeon, Eucharis said to
me: 'It is Spring.'"</p>

<h3><a name="II" id="II">CHAPTER II</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE HOUSE OF KERIVAL</p>


<p>It was with a sudden beating of the heart
that, midway in Easter, Alan de Kerival received
in Paris two letters: one from the Marquis
de Kerival, and the other from his cousin
Ynys, whom he loved.</p>

<p>At all times he was ill at ease in the great
city; or at all times save when he was alone
in his little study in the Tour de l'Ile, or in
the great circular room where the master
astronomer, Daniel Darc, wrought unceasingly.
On rare occasions, golden afternoons
these, he escaped to the green places near
Paris&mdash;to Rambouillet or St. Germain, or even
to Fontainebleau. There, under the leafless
trees of winter or at the first purpling of
spring, he was wont to walk for hours, dreaming
his dream. For Alan was a poet, and to
dream was his birthright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>And for dream, what had he? There was
Ynys above all, Ynys whom he loved with ever
deepening joy and wonder. More and more
she had become to him his real life; he lived
in her, for her, because of her. More and
more, too, he realized that she was his
strength, his inspiration. But besides this
abiding delight, which made his heart leap
whenever he saw a Breton name above a shop
or on a volume on the bookstalls, he was ever
occupied by that wonderful past of his race
which was to him a living reality. It was
perhaps because he so keenly perceived the
romance of the present&mdash;the romance of the
general hour, of the individual moment&mdash;that
he turned so insatiably to the past with its
deathless charm, its haunting appeal. The
great astronomer whom he loved and served
knew the young man well, and was wont to say
that his favorite assistant was born a thousand
years too late.</p>

<p>One day a Breton neighbor of the Marquis
de Kerival questioned Daniel Darc as to
who the young man's friends were. "Nomenoë,
Gradlon-Maur, Gwenc'hlan, Taliésin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Merlin, and Oisin," was the reply. And it
was true. Alan's mind was as irresistibly
drawn to the Celtic world of the past as the
swallow to the sun-way. In a word, he was
not only a poet, but a Celtic poet; and not
only a Celtic poet, but a dreamer of the Celtic
dream.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was because of the double
strain in his veins. Doubtless, too, it was
continuously enhanced by his intimate knowledge
of two of the Celtic languages, that of
the Breton and that of the Gael. It is language
that is the surest stimulus to the remembering
nerves. We have a memory within
memory, as layers of skin underlie the epidermis.
With most of us this anterior remembrance
remains dormant throughout life; but
to some are given swift ancestral recollections.
Alan de Kerival was of these few.</p>

<p>His aunt, the Marquise, true Gael of the
Hebrid Isles as she was, loved the language of
her people, and spoke it as she spoke English,
even better than French. Of Breton, save a
few words and phrases, she knew almost
nothing&mdash;though Armorican was exclusively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
used throughout the whole Kerival region,
was the common tongue in the Manor itself,
and was habitually affected even by the Marquis
de Kerival&mdash;on the few occasions when
Tristran the Silent, as the old nobleman was
named, cared to speak. But with two members
of the household she invariably spoke in
Gaelic; with her nephew Alan, the child of
her sister Silis Macdonald, and her old servitor,
Ian Macdonald, known among his fellows
as Yann the Dumb, mainly because he seldom
spoke to them, having no language but his
own. Latterly, her daughter Ynys had become
as familiar with the one Celtic tongue
as the other.</p>

<p>With this double key, Alan unlocked many
doors. All the wonderful romance of old
Armorica and of ancient Wales was familiar
to him, and he was deeply versed in the still
more wonderful and magical lore of the Gaelic
race. In his brain ran ever that Ossianic tide
which has borne so many marvellous argosies
through the troubled waters of the modern
mind. Old ballads of his native isles, with
their haunting Gaelic rhythms and idioms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
their frequent reminiscences of the Norse viking
and the Danish summer-sailor, were often
in his ears. He had lived with his hero Cuchullin
from the days when the boy showed his
royal blood at Emain-Macha till that sad hour
when his madness came upon him and he died.
He had fared forth with many a Lifting of the
Sunbeam, and had followed Oisin step by step
on that last melancholy journey when Malvina
led the blind old man along the lonely shores
of Arran. He had watched the <i>crann-tara</i>
flare from glen to glen, and at the bidding of
that fiery cross he had seen the whirling of
swords, the dusky flight of arrow-rain, and,
from the isles, the leaping forth of the war
<i>birlinns</i> to meet the viking galleys. How
often, too, he had followed Nial of the Nine
Hostages, and had seen the Irish Charlemagne
ride victor through Saxon London, or
across the Norman plains, or with onward
sword direct his army against the white walls
of the Alps! How often he had been with the
great king Nomonoë, when he with his Armoricans
chased the Frankish wolves away from
Breton soil, or had raced with Gradlon-Maur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
from the drowning seas which overwhelmed Ys,
where the king's daughter had at the same
moment put her hands on the Gates of Love
and Death! How often he had heard Merlin
and Taliésin speak of the secret things of the
ancient wisdom, or Gwenc'hlan chant upon
his wild harp, or the fugitive song of Vivien in
the green woods of Broceliande, where the enchanted
seer sleeps his long sleep and dreams
his dream of eternal youth.</p>

<p>It was all this marvellous life of old which
wrought upon Alan de Kerival's life as by a
spell. Often he recalled the words of a
Gaelic <i>sian</i> he had heard Yann croon in his
soft, monotonous voice&mdash;words which made a
light shoreward eddy of the present and were
solemn with the deep-sea sound of the past,
that is with us even as we speak.</p>

<p>He was himself, too, a poet, and loved to
tell anew, in Breton, to the peasants of Kerival,
some of the wild north tales, or to relate
in Gaelic to his aunt and to Ynys the beautiful
folk-ballads of Brittany, which Annaik
knew by heart and chanted with the strange,
wailing music of the forest-wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>In that old Manor, moreover, another
shadow put a gloom into his mind&mdash;this was
another shadow than that which made the
house so silent and chill, the inviolate isolation
of the paralyzed but still beautiful
Marquise Lois from her invalid husband, limb-useless
from his thighs because of a hurt done
in the war into which he had gone brown-haired
and strong, and whence he had come
broken in hope, shattered in health, and gray
with premature age. And this other shadow
was the mystery of his birth.</p>

<p>It was in vain he had tried to learn the
name of his father. Only three people knew
it: the Marquis Tristran, the Marquise Lois,
and Yann the Dumb. From none of these
could he elicit more than what he had long
known. All was to be made clear on his
twenty-fifth birthday; till then he had to be
content with the knowledge that he was Alan
de Kerival by courtesy only; that he was the
son of Silis Macdonald, of an ancient family
whose ancestral home was in one of the isles
of the Southern Hebrides, of Silis, the dead
sister of Lois de Kerival; and that he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
adopted child of the Marquis and Marquise
who bore that old Armoric name.</p>

<p>That there was tragedy inwrought with his
story he knew well. From fugitive words,
too, he had gained the idea that his father, in
common with the Marquis Tristran, had been
a soldier in the French army; though as to
whether this unknown parent was Scottish or
Breton or French, or as to whether he was
alive or dead, there was no homing clew.</p>

<p>To all his enquiries of the Marquise he
received no answer, or was told simply that he
must wait. The Marquis he rarely saw, and
never spoke with. If ever he encountered
the stern, white-haired man as he was wheeled
through the garden ways or down one of the
green alleys, or along the corridors of the
vast, rambling château, they passed in silence.
Sometimes the invalid would look at him with
the fierce, unwavering eyes of a hawk; but
for the most part the icy, steel-blue eyes
ignored the young man altogether.</p>

<p>Yann, too, could not, or would not confide
any thing more than Alan had already learned
from the Marquise. The gaunt old Hebridean&mdash;whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sole recreation, when not sitting
pipe in mouth before the flaming logs, was to
wander along the melancholy dunes by the
melancholy gray sea, and mutter continuously
to himself in his soft island-Gaelic&mdash;would
talk slowly by the hour on old legends, and
ballad-lore, and on seanachas of every kind.
When, however, Alan asked him about the
sisters Lois and Silis Macdonald, or how Lois
came to marry a Breton, and as to the man
Silis loved, and what the name was of the isle
whereon they lived,&mdash;or even as to whether
Ian himself had kith or kin living,&mdash;Yann
would justify his name. He took no trouble
in evasion: he simply became dumb.</p>

<p>Sometimes Alan asked the old man if he
cared to see the Isles again. At that, a look
ever came into Ian Macdonald's eyes which
made his young clansman love him.</p>

<p>"It will never, never be forgetting my own
place I will be," he replied once, "no, never.
I would rather be hearing the sea on the
shores there than all the hymns of heaven, and
I would rather be having the canna and the
heather over my head than be under the altar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of the great church at Kerloek. No, no, it
is the pain I have for my own place, and the
isle where my blood has been for hundreds of
years, and where for sure my heart is, Alan
Mac&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With eager ears Alan had hoped for the
name whereat the old man had stopped short.
It would have told him much. "Alan, son
of&mdash;&mdash;!" Even that baptismal name would
probably have told him if his father were a
Gael or a Breton, an Englishman or a Frenchman.
But Yann said no more, then or later.</p>

<p>Alan had hoped, too, that when he came
back, after his first long absence from Kerival,
his aunt would be more explicit with him. A
vain hope, for when once more he was at the
château he found the Marquise even less
communicative than was her wont. Her
husband was more than ever taciturn, and a
gloom seemed to have descended upon the
house. For the first time he noticed a change
in the attitude of Annaik. Her great, scornful,
wild-bird eyes looked at him often
strangely. She sought him, and then was
silent. If he did not speak, she became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
morose; if he spoke, she relapsed into her
old scornful quiescence. Sometimes, when
they were alone, she unbent, and was his
beautiful cousin and comrade again; but in
the presence of Ynys she bewildered him
by her sudden ennui or bitterness or even
shadowy hostility. As for Ynys, she was unhappy,
save in Alan's love&mdash;a love that
neither her father nor mother knew, and of
which she never spoke to Annaik.</p>

<p>If Alan were a dreamer, Ynys was even
more so. Then, too, she had what Annaik
had not, though she lacked what her sister
had. For she was mystical as that young
saint of the Bretons who saw Christ walking
by night upon the hills, and believed that he
met there a new Endymion, his Bride of the
Church come to him in the moonshine. Ynys
believed in St. Guennik, as she believed in
Jeanne d'Arc, and no legend fascinated her
more than that strange one she had heard
from Yann, of how Arthur the Celtic hero
would come again out of Flath-innis, and
redeem his lost, receding peoples. But, unlike
Annaik, she had little of the barbaric passion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
little of that insatiate nostalgia for the life of
the open moor and the windy sea, though
these she loved not less whole-heartedly than
did her sister. The two both loved Nature as
few women love her; but to Annaik the forest
and the moorland were home, while to Ynys
they were rather sanctuaries or realms of
natural romance. This change to an unwelcome
taciturnity had been noted by Alan
on his home visit at Christmas. Still, he
had thought little of it after his return to
Paris, for the Noël-tide had been sweetened
by the word given to him by Ynys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then Easter had come, and with it the two
letters of such import. That from the Marquise
was short and in the tongue he and she
loved best: but even thus it was written guardedly.
The purport was that, now his twenty-fifth
birthday was at hand, he would soon
learn what he had so long wished to know.</p>

<p>That from Ynys puzzled him. Why should
dispeace have arisen between Ynys and
Annaik? Why should an already gloomy
house have been made still more sombre?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, Ynys wrote, she had come upon
Annaik riding Sultan, the black stallion, and
thrashing the horse till the foam flew from the
champed bit. When she had cried to Annaik
to be merciful, and asked her why she
punished Sultan so, her sister had cried
mockingly, "It is my love! <i>Addio, Amore!
Addio! Addio! Addio!</i>"&mdash;and at each <i>addio</i> had
brought her whip so fiercely upon the stallion's
quivering flanks that he had reared, and
all but thrown her, till she swung him round
as on a pivot and went at a wild gallop down
a long beech-alley that led into the heart of
the forest.</p>

<p>Well, these things would be better understood
soon. In another week he would be
out of Paris, possibly never to return. And
then ... Brittany&mdash;Kerival&mdash;Ynys!</p>

<p>Nevertheless his heart was not wholly away
from his work. The great astronomer had
known and loved Hersart de Kerival, the
younger brother of Tristran, and it was for
his sake that he had taken the young man
into his observatory. Soon he had discovered
that the youth loved the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
science, and was apt, eager, and yet patient
to learn. In the five years which Alan
spent&mdash;with brief Brittany intervals&mdash;in the
observatory of the Tour de l'Ile, he had come
to delight in the profession which he had
chosen, and of which the Marquise had
approved.</p>

<p>He was none the less close and eager a student
because that he brought to this enthralling
science that spirit of the poetry of the
past, which was the habitual atmosphere
wherein his mind dwelt. Even the most
eloquent dissertations of Daniel Darc failed
to move him so much as some ancient strain
wherein the stars of heaven were hailed as
kindred of men; and never had any exposition
of the lunar mystery so exquisitely troubled
him as that wonderful cry of Ossian which
opens the poem of "Darthula":</p>

<p>"Daughter of heaven, fair art thou! the
silence of thy face is pleasant. Thou comest
forth in loveliness; the stars attend thy blue
steps in the east. The clouds rejoice in thy
presence, O moon, and brighten their dark-brown
sides. Who is like thee in heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
daughter of the night? The stars are ashamed
in thy presence, and turn aside their green
sparkling eyes. Whither dost thou retire
from thy course, when the darkness of thy
countenance grows? Hast thou thy hall like
Ossian? Dwellest thou in the shadow of grief?
Have thy sisters fallen from heaven? Are
they who rejoiced with thee, at night, no
more?&mdash;Yes!&mdash;They have fallen, fair light!
and thou dost often retire to mourn. But
thou thyself shalt fail, one night; and leave
thy blue path in heaven. The stars will then
lift their green heads; they, who were ashamed
in thy presence, will rejoice."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="III" id="III">CHAPTER III</a></h3>

<p class="center">STORM</p>


<p>Yes, he was glad to leave Paris, although
that home of lost causes&mdash;thus designate in
a far truer sense than is the fair city by the
Isis&mdash;had a spell for him. But not Paris,
not even what, night after night, he beheld
from the Tour de l'Ile, held him under a spell
comparable with that which drew him back
to the ancient land where his heart was.</p>

<p>In truth, it was with relief at last that he
saw the city recede from his gaze, and merge
into the green alleys north-westward. With
a sigh of content, he admitted that it was
indeed well to escape from that fevered life&mdash;a
life that, to him, even in his lightest mood,
seemed far more phantasmal than that which
formed the background to all his thoughts
and visions. Long before the cherry
orchards above Rouen came into view he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
realized how glad he was even to be away from
the bare, gaunt room where so many of his
happiest hours had been spent; that windy
crow's-nest of a room at the top of the Tour
de l'Ile, whence nightly he had watched the
procession of the stars, and nightly had
opened the dreamland of his imagination to
an even more alluring procession out of the
past.</p>

<p>His one regret was in having to part from
Daniel Darc, that strange and impressive
personality who had so fascinated him, and the
spell of whose sombre intellect, with its dauntless
range and scope, had startled the thought
of Europe, and even given dreams to many to
whom all dreams had become the very Fata
Morgana of human life.</p>

<p>Absorbed as he was, Daniel Darc realized
that Alan was an astronomer primarily because
he was a poet rather than an astronomer by
inevitable bias. He saw clearly into the
young man's mind, and certainly did not
resent that his favorite pupil loved to dwell
with Merlin rather than with Kepler, and
that even Newton or his own master Arago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
had no such influence over him as the far-off,
nigh inaudible music of the harp of
Aneurin.</p>

<p>And, in truth, below all Alan's passion for
science&mdash;of that science which is at once the
oldest, the noblest, and the most momentous;
the science of the innumerous concourse of
dead, dying, and flaming adolescent worlds,
dust about the threshold of an unfathomable
and immeasurable universe, wherein this
Earth of ours is no more than a mere whirling
grain of sand&mdash;below all this living
devotion lay a deeper passion still.</p>

<p>Truly, his soul must have lived a thousand
years ago. In him, at least, the old Celtic
brain was reborn with a vivid intensity which
none guessed, and none except Ynys knew&mdash;if
even she, for Alan himself only vaguely surmised
the extent and depth of this obsession.
In heart and brain that old world lived anew.
Himself a poet, all that was fair and tragically
beautiful was forever undergoing in his mind
a marvellous transformation&mdash;a magical resurrection
rather, wherein what was remote and
bygone, and crowned with oblivious dust,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
became alive again with intense and beautiful
life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It did not harmonize ill with Alan's mood
that, on the afternoon of the day he left
Rouen, great, bulbous storm-clouds soared out
of the west and cast a gloom upon the
landscape.</p>

<p>That is a strange sophistry which registers
passion according to its nearness to the blithe
weal symbolized in fair weather. Deep passion
instinctively moves toward the shadow
rather than toward the golden noons of
light. Passion hears what love at the most
dreams of; passion sees what love mayhap
dimly discerns in a glass darkly. A million
of our fellows are "in love" at any or every
moment; and for these the shadowy way
is intolerable. But for the few, in whom
love is, the eyes are circumspect against
the dark hour which comes when heart and
brain and blood are aflame with the paramount
ecstasy of life.</p>

<p>Deep passion is always in love with death.
The temperate solicitudes of affection know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
not this perverse emotion, which is simply
the darker shadow inevitable to a deeper
joy&mdash;as the profundity of an Alpine lake is
to be measured by the height of the remote
summits which rise sheer from its marge.</p>

<p>When Alan saw this gloom slowly absorb
the sunlight, and heard below the soft spring
cadences of the wind the moan of coming
tempest, his melancholy lightened. Soon he
would see the storm crushing through the
woods of Kerival; soon feel the fierce rain
come sweeping inland from Ploumaliou; soon
hear, confusedly obscure, the noise of the
Breton Sea along the reef-set sands. Already
he felt the lips of Ynys pressed against his
own.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sound of the sea called through the
dusk, now with the muffled under roar of
famished lions, now with a loud, continuous
baying like that of eager hounds.</p>

<p>Seaward, the deepening shadows passed
intricately from wave to wave. The bays and
sheltered waters were full of a tumult as of
baffled flight, of fugitives jostling each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
in a wild and fruitless evasion. Along the interminable
reach of the Dunes of Kerival the
sea's lips writhed and curled; while out of the
heart of the turbulent waste beyond issued a
shrill, intermittent crying, followed by stifled
laughter. Ever and again tons of whirling
water, meeting, disparted with a hoarse thunder.
This ever-growing and tempestuous
violence was reiterated in a myriad raucous,
clamant voices along the sands and among the
reefs and rocks and weed-covered wave-hollowed
crags.</p>

<p>Above the shore a ridge of tamarisk-fringed
dune suspended, hanging there dark
and dishevelled, like a gigantic eyebrow on
the forehead of a sombre and mysterious
being. Beyond this, again, lay a stretch of
barren moor, caught and claspt a mile away
by a dark belt of pines, amid which the incessant
volume of the wind passed with a shrill
whistling. Further in among the trees were
oases of a solemn silence, filled only at intervals
with a single flute-like wind-eddy, falling
there as the song of a child lost and baffled in
a waste place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Over and above the noise of the sea was a
hoarse cry thridding it as a flying shuttle in
a gigantic loom. This was the wind, which
continuously swept from wave to wave&mdash;shrewd,
salt, bitter with the sterile breath of
the wilderness whereon it roamed, crying and
moaning, baying, howling, insatiate.</p>

<p>The sea-fowl, congregating from afar, had
swarmed inland. Their wailing cries filled the
spray-wet obscurities. The blackness that
comes before the deepest dark lay in the hollow
of the great wings of the tempest. Peace nowhere
prevailed, for in those abysmal depths
where the wind was not even a whisper, there
was listless gloom only, because no strife is there,
and no dream lives amid those silent apathies.</p>

<p>Neither upon the waters nor on the land
was there sign of human life. In that remote
region, solitude was not a dream but a reality.
An ancient land, this loneliest corner of sea-washed
Brittany; an ancient land, with ever
upon it the light of olden dreams, the gloom
of indefinable tragedy, the mystery of a destiny
long ago begun and never fulfilled.</p>

<p>Lost like a rock in a forest, a weather-worn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
ivy-grown château stood within sound, though
not within sight, of this tempestuous sea. All
about it was the deep, sonorous echo of wind
and wave, transmuted into a myriad cries
among the wailing pines and oaks and vast
beeches of the woods of Kerival. Wind and
wave, too, made themselves audible amid the
gables and in the huge chimneys of the old
manor-house; even in the draughty corridors
an echo of the sea could be heard.</p>

<p>The pathways of the forest were dank with
sodden leaves, the <i>débris</i> of autumn which
the snows of winter had saved from the whirling
gales of January. Underneath the brushwood
and the lower boughs these lay in brown,
clotted masses, emitting a fugitive, indefinite
odor, as though the ghost of a dead year
passed in that damp and lifeless effluence.
But along the frontiers of the woods there
was an eddying dust of leaves and small twigs,
and part at least of the indeterminate rumor
which filled the air was caused by this frail
lapping as of innumerable minute wings.</p>

<p>In one of those leaf-quiet alleys, shrouded
in a black-green darkness save where in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
spot the gloom was illumined into a vivid
brown, because of a wandering beam of light
from a turret in the château, a man stood.
The head was forwardly inclined, the whole
figure intent as a listening animal. He and
his shadow were as those flowers of darkness
whose nocturnal bloom may be seen of none
save in the shadowy land of dream.</p>

<p>When for a moment the wind-wavered beam
of light fell athwart his face&mdash;so dark and
wild that he might well have been taken for a
nameless creature of the woods&mdash;he moved.</p>

<p>With a sudden gesture he flung his arms
above his head. His shadow sprang to one
side with fantastic speed, leaping like a diver
into the gulf of darkness.</p>

<p>"Annaik," he cried, "Annaik, Annaik!"</p>

<p>The moan of the wind out of the sea, the
confused noise of the wind's wings baffling
through the woods; no other answer than
these, no other sound.</p>

<p>"Annaik, Annaik!"</p>

<p>There was pain as of a wounded beast in
the harsh cry of this haunter of the dark; but
the next moment it was as though the lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
shadow had leapt back, for a darkness came
about the man, and he lapsed into the obscurity
as a wave sinks into a wave.</p>

<p>But, later, out of the silence came a voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, Annaik!" it cried, "ah, Annaik, forsooth!
It is Annaik of Kerival you are, and
I the dust upon the land of your fathers&mdash;but,
by the blood of Ronan, it is only a woman
you are; and, if I had you here it is a fall of
my fist you would be having&mdash;aye, the stroke
and the blow, for all that I love you as I do,
white woman, aye, and curse you and yours
for that loving!"</p>

<p>Then, once again, there was silence. Only
the screeching of the wind among the leaves
and tortured branches; only the deep roar of
the tempest at the heart of the forest; only
the thunder of the sea throbbing pulse-like
through the night. Nor when, a brief while
later, a white owl, swifter but not less silent
than a drift of vapor, swooped that way, was
there living creature in that solitary place.</p>

<p>The red-yellow beam still turned into
brown the black-green of that windy alley;
but the man, and the shadow of him, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
pain of the beast that was in him, and the cry
of the baffled soul, the cry that none might
know or even guess&mdash;of all this sorrow of the
night, nothing remained save the red light
lifting and falling through the shadowy hair
of what the poets of old called The Dark
Woman ... Night.</p>

<p>Only, who may know if, in that warmth and
glow within the House of Kerival, some
sudden menace from the outside world of life
did not knock at the heart of Annaik, where
she, tall and beautiful in her cream-white
youth and with her mass of tawny hair, stood
by Ynys, whose dusky loveliness was not less
than her own&mdash;both radiant in the fire-light,
with laughter upon the lips and light within
their eyes.</p>

<p>Oh, flame that burns where fires of home
are lit! and oh, flame that burns in the heart
to whom life has not said, Awake! and oh,
flame that smoulders from death to life, and
from life to death, in the dumb lives of those
to whom the primrose way is closed! Everywhere
the burning of the burning, the flame
of the flame; pain and the shadow of pain, joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and the rapt breath of joy, flame of the flame
that, burning, destroyeth not till the flame is
no more!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the night of the home-coming of
Alan. So long had Ynys and Annaik looked
forward to this hour, that now hardly could
they believe the witness of their eyes when
with eager glances they scrutinized the new-comer&mdash;their
Alanik of old.</p>

<p>He stood before the great fire of logs.
Upon his face the sharp, damp breath of the
storm still lingered, but in his eyes was a
light brighter than any dancing flame would
cause, and in his blood a pulse that leapt
because of another reason than that swift ride
through the stormy woods of Kerival.</p>

<p>At the red and stormy break of that day
Ynys had awaked with a song of joy in her
heart that from hour to hour had found expression
in bird-like carollings, little words
and fugitive phrases which rippled from her
lips, the sunshine-spray from the fount of life
whereon her heart swam as a nenuphar on an
upwelling pool. Annaik also had waked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that dawn of storm. She had risen in silence,
and in silence had remained all day; giving
no sign that the flame within her frayed the
nerves of her heart.</p>

<p>Throughout the long hours of tempest, and
into that dusk wherein the voice of the sea
moved, moaning, across the land, laughter and
dream had alternated with Ynys. Annaik
looked at her strangely at times, but said
nothing. Once, standing in the twilight of
the dark-raftered room, Ynys clasped her
hands across her bosom and murmured,
"Oh, heart be still! My heaven is come."
And in that hour, and in that place, she who
was twin to her&mdash;strange irony of motherhood,
that should give birth in one hour to
Day and Night, for even as day and night
were these twain, so unlike in all things&mdash;in
that hour and in that place Annaik also
clasped her hands across her bosom, and the
words that died across the shadow of her lips
were, "Oh, heart be still! My hell is near."</p>

<p>And now he for whom both had waited
stood, flooded in the red fire glow which leaped
from panel to panel, and from rafter to rafter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
while, without, the howling of the wind rose
and fell in prolonged, monotonous cadences,&mdash;anathemas,
rather,&mdash;whirled through a darkness
full of bewilderment and terror.</p>

<p>As for Alan, it was indeed for joy to him to
stand there, home once more, with not only
the savagery of the tempest behind him, but
also left behind, that unspeakably far-off,
bewilderingly remote city of Paris whence he
had so swiftly come.</p>

<p>It is said of an ancient poet of the Druid
days that he had the power to see the lives of
the living, and these as though they were
phantoms, separate from the body. Was
there not a young king of Albainn who, in a
perilous hour, discovered this secret of old
time, and knew how a life may be hidden
away from the body so that none may know
of it, save the wind that whispers all things,
and the tides of day and night that bear all
things upon their dark flood?</p>

<p>King of Albainn, poet of the old time, not
alone three youthful dreamers would you
have seen, there, in that storm-beset room.
For there you would have seen six figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
standing side by side. Three of these would
have been Alan de Kerival, and Ynys the
Dark, and Annaik the Fair; and of the other
three, one would be of a dusky-haired woman
with starry, luminous eyes; and one a pale
woman with a wealth of tawny hair, with eyes
aflame, meteors in a desert place; and one
a man, young and strong and fair to see as
Alan de Kerival, but round about him a
gloom, and through that gloom his eyes as
stars seen among the melancholy hills.</p>

<p>Happy laughter of the world that is always
young&mdash;happy, in that we are not all seers of
old or kings of Albainn! For who, looking
into the mirrors of Life and seeing all that is
to be seen, would look again, save those few
to whom Life and Death have come sisterly
and whispered the secret that some have discerned,
how these twain are one and the same.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in that happy hour for him,
Alan saw nothing of what Ynys feared.
Annaik had abruptly yielded to a strange
gayety, and her swift laugh and gypsy smile
made his heart glad.</p>

<p>Never had he seen, even in Paris, women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
more beautiful. Deep-set as his heart was in
the beauty of Ynys, he found himself admiring
that of Annaik with new eyes. Truly, she
was just such a woman as he had often imagined
when Ian had recited to him the ballad
of the Sons of Usna or that of how Dermid
and Graine fled from the wrath of Fionn.</p>

<p>And they, too, looking at their tall cousin,
with his wavy brown hair, broad, low brows,
gray-blue eyes, and erect carriage, thought
him the comeliest man to be seen in France;
and each in her own way was proud and glad,
though one, also, with killing pain.</p>

<h3><a name="IV" id="IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE DREAM AND THE DREAMERS</p>


<p>Soon after supper Annaik withdrew.
Ynys and Alan were glad to be alone, and
yet Annaik's absence perturbed them. In
going she bade good-night to her cousin, but
took no notice of her sister.</p>

<p>At first the lovers were silent though they had
much to say, and in particular Alan was anxious
to know what it was that Ynys had alluded
to in her letter when she warned him that
unforeseen difficulties were about their way.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to sit in that low-roofed,
dark old room, and feel the world fallen away
from them. Hand in hand they looked at
each other lovingly, or dreamed into the
burning logs, seeing there all manner of
beautiful visions. Outside, the wind still
moaned and howled, though with less of
savage violence, and the rain had ceased.</p>

<p>For a time Ynys would have no talk of Kerival;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Alan was to tell all he could concerning
his life in Paris, what he had done, what he
had dreamed of, and what he hoped for now.
But at last he laughingly refused to speak more
of himself, and pressed her to reveal what had
been a source of anxiety.</p>

<p>"You know, dear," she said, as she rose
and leaned against the mantel-piece, her tall
figure and dusky hair catching a warm glow
from the fire&mdash;"you know how pitiable is this
feud between my father and mother&mdash;how for
years they have seen next to nothing of each
other; how they live in the same house and yet
are strangers? You know, too, how more than
ever unfortunate this is, for themselves, and
for Annaik and me, on account of our mother
being an invalid, and of our father being
hardly less frail. Well, I have discovered
that the chief, if not indeed the only abiding
source of misunderstanding is <i>you</i>, dear Alan!"</p>

<p>"But why, Ynys?"</p>

<p>"Ah, why? That is, of course, what I
cannot tell you. Have you no suspicion,
no idea?"</p>

<p>"None. All I know is that M. de Kerival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
allows me to bear his name, but that he dislikes,
if, indeed, he does not actually hate
me."</p>

<p>"There is some reason. I came upon him
talking to my mother a short time ago. She
had told him of your imminent return.</p>

<p>"'I never wish to see his face,' my father
cried, with fierce vehemence; then, seeing me,
he refrained."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall know all the day after to-morrow.
Meanwhile, Ynys, we have the night
to ourselves. Dear, I want to learn one
thing. What does Annaik know? Does she
know that we love each other? Does she
know that we have told each other of this
love, and that we are secretly betrothed?"</p>

<p>"She <i>must</i> know that I love you; and sometimes
I think she knows that you love me.
But ... oh, Allan! I am so unhappy about
it.... I fear that Annaik loves you also,
and that this will come between us all. It
has already frozen her to me and me to her."</p>

<p>Alan looked at Ynys with startled eyes.
He knew Annaik better than any one did;
and he dreaded the insurgent bitterness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
that wild and wayward nature. Moreover, in
a sense he loved her, and it was for sorrow to
him that she should suffer in a way wherein
he could be of no help.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened, and
Matieu, a white-haired old servant, bowing
ceremoniously, remarked that M. le Marquis
desired to see Mamzelle Ynys immediately.</p>

<p>Ynys glanced round, told Matieu that she
would follow, and then turned to Alan.
How beautiful she was! he thought; more and
more beautiful every time he saw her. Ah!
fair mystery of love, which puts a glory about
the one loved; a glory that is no phantasmal
light, but the realized beauty evoked by seeing
eyes and calling heart. On her face was
a wonderful color, a delicate flush that came
and went. Again and again she made a characteristic
gesture, putting her right hand to
her forehead and then through the shadowy,
wavy hair which Alan loved so well and ever
thought of as the fragrant dusk. How glad
he was that she was tall and lithe, graceful as
a young birch; that she was strong and kissed
brown and sweet of sun and wind; that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
beauty was old as the world, and fresh as
every dawn, and new as each recurrent spring!
No wonder he was a poet, since Ynys was the
living poem who inspired all that was best in
his life, all that was fervent in his brain.</p>

<p>Thought, kindred to this, kept him a long
while by the fire in deep revery, after Ynys
had thrilled him by her parting kisses and
had gone to her father. He realized, then,
how it was she gave him the sense of womanhood
as no other woman had done. In her,
he recognized the symbol as well as the individual.
All women shared in his homage
because of her. His deep love for her, his
ever growing passion, could evoke from him a
courtesy, a chivalry, toward all women which
only the callous or the coarse failed to note.
She was his magic. The light of their love
was upon every thing: everywhere he found
synonyms and analogues of "Ynys." Deeply
as he loved beauty, he had learned to love it
far more keenly and understandingly, because
of her. He saw now through the accidental,
and everywhere discerned the eternal beauty,
the echoes of whose wandering are in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
heart and brain, though few discern the white
vision or hear the haunting voice.</p>

<p>And with his love had come knowledge of
many things hidden from him before. Sequences
were revealed, where he had perceived
only blind inconsequence. Nature
became for him a scroll, a palimpsest with
daily mutations. With each change he found
a word, a clew, leading to the fuller elucidation
of that primeval knowledge which, fragmentarily,
from age to age has been painfully
lost, regained, and lost again, though never
yet wholly irrecoverable.</p>

<p>Through this new knowledge, too, he had
come to understand the supreme wonder and
promise, the supreme hope of our human life
in the mystery of motherhood. All this and
much more he owed to Ynys, and to his love
for her. She was all that a woman can be to a
man. In her he found the divine abstractions
which are the beacons of the human soul
in its obscure wayfaring&mdash;Romance, Love,
Beauty. It was not enough that she gave
him romance, that she gave him love, that she
was the most beautiful of women in his eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
When he thought of the one, it was to see the
starry eyes and to hear the charmed voice of
Romance herself, in the voice and in the eyes
of Ynys: when he thought of Love it was to
hear Ynys's heart beating, to listen to the
secret rhythms in Ynys's brain, to feel the
life-giving sun-flood that was in her pure but
intense and glowing passion.</p>

<p>Thus it was that she had for him that immutable
attraction which a few women have
for a few men; an appeal, a charm, that atmosphere
of romance, that air of ideal beauty,
wherein lies the secret of all passionate art.
The world without wonder, the world without
mystery! That, indeed, is the rainbow without
colors, the sunrise without living gold,
the noon void of light.</p>

<p>To him, moreover, there was but one
woman. In Ynys he had found her. This
exquisite prototype was at once a child of
nature, a beautiful pagan, a daughter of the
sun; was at once this and a soul alive with the
spiritual life, intent upon the deep meanings
lurking everywhere, wrought to wonder even
by the common habitudes of life, to mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
even by the familiar and the explicable. Indeed,
the mysticism which was part of the
spiritual inheritance come with her northern
strain was one of the deep bonds which united
them.</p>

<p>What if both at times were wrought too
deeply by this beautiful dream? What if the
inner life triumphed now and then, and each
forgot the deepest instinct of life, that here
the body is overlord and the soul but a divine
consort? There are three races of man.
There is the myriad race which loses all,
through (not bestiality, for the brute world is
clean and sane) perverted animalism; and
there is the myriad race which denounces
humanity, and pins all its faith and joy to a
life the very conditions of whose existence
are incompatible with the law to which we are
subject&mdash;the sole law, the law of Nature.
Then there is that small untoward clan, which
knows the divine call of the spirit through the
brain, and the secret whisper of the soul in
the heart, and forever perceives the veils of
mystery and the rainbows of hope upon our
human horizons; which hears and sees, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
yet turns wisely, meanwhile, to the life of the
green earth, of which we are part; to the
common kindred of living things, with which
we are at one&mdash;is content, in a word, to live,
because of the dream that makes living so
mysteriously sweet and poignant; and to
dream, because of the commanding immediacy
of life.</p>

<p>As yet, of course, Alan and Ynys had
known little of the vicissitudes of aroused
life. What they did know, foresee, was due
rather to the second-sight of the imagination
than to the keen knowledge of experience.</p>

<p>In Alan Ynys found all that her heart
craved. She discovered this nearly too late.
A year before this last home-coming of her
cousin, she had been formally betrothed to
Andrik de Morvan, the friend of her childhood
and for whom she had a true affection,
and in that betrothal had been quietly glad.
When, one midwinter day, she and Alan
walked through an upland wood and looked
across the snowy pastures and the white
slopes beyond, all aglow with sunlight, and
then suddenly turned toward each other, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
saw in the eyes of each a wonderful light, and
the next moment were heart to heart, it was
all a revelation.</p>

<p>For long she did not realize what it meant.
On that unforgettable day, when they had
left the forest ridge and were near Kerival
again, she had sat for a time on one of the
rude cattle-gates which are frequent in these
woodlands, while Alan had leant beside her,
looking up with eyes too eloquent, and speaking
of what he dreamed, with sweet stammering
speech of new found love.</p>

<p>How she had struggled, mentally, with her
duty, as she conceived it, toward Andrik.
She was betrothed to him; he loved her; she
loved him too, although even already she
realized that there is a love which is not only
invincible and indestructible but that comes
unsought, has no need for human conventions,
is neither moral nor immoral but
simply all-potent and thenceforth sovereign.
To yield to that may be wrong; but, if so,
it is wrong to yield to the call of hunger, the
cry of thirst, the whisper of sleep, the breath
of ill, the summons of death. It comes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
that is all. The green earth may be another
Endymion, and may dream that the cold
moonshine is all in all; but when the sun
rises, and a new heat and glory and passion
of life are come, then Endymion simply
awakes.</p>

<p>It had been a sadness to her to have to tell
Andrik she no longer loved him as he was
fain to be loved. He would have no finality,
then; he held her to the bond&mdash;and in Brittany
there is a pledge akin to the "hand-fast"
of the north, which makes a betrothal
almost as binding as marriage.</p>

<p>Andrik de Morvan had gone to the Marquis
de Kerival, and told him what Ynys had
said.</p>

<p>"She is but a girl," the seigneur remarked
coldly. "And you are wrong in thinking she
can be in love with any one else. There is no
one for whom she can care so much as for
you; no one whom she has met with whom
she could mate; no one with whom I would
allow her to mate."</p>

<p>"But that matters little, if she will not
marry me!" the young man had urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"My daughter is my daughter, De Morvan.
I cannot compel her to marry you. I know
her well enough to be sure that she would
ignore any command of this kind. But
women are fools; and one can get them to
do what one wants, in one way if not in
another. Let her be a while."</p>

<p>"But the betrothal!"</p>

<p>"Let it stand. But do not press it. Indeed,
go away for a year. You are heir to
your mother's estates in Touraine. Go there,
work, learn all you can. Meanwhile, write
occasionally to Ynys. Do not address her
as your betrothed, but at the same time let
her see that it is the lover who writes. Then,
after a few months, confide that your absence
is due solely to her, that you cannot live
without her; and that, after a vain exile, you
write to ask if you may come and see her.
They are all the same. It is the same thing
with my mares, for which Kerival is so famous.
Some are wild, some are docile, some skittish,
some vicious, some good, a few flawless&mdash;but....
Well, they are all mares. One
knows. A mare is not a sphinx. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
complexities of which we hear so much, what
are they? Spindrift. The sea is simply the
sea, all the same. The tide ebbs, though the
poets reverse nature. Ebb and flow, the lifting
wind, the lifted wave; we know the way of
it all. It has its mystery, its beauty; but we
don't really expect to see a nereid in the
hollow of the wave, or to catch the echo of a
triton in the call of the wind. As for Venus
Anadyomene, the foam of which she was made
is the froth in poets' brains. Believe me,
Annaik, my friend, women are simply women;
creatures not yet wholly tamed, but tractable
in the main, delightful, valuable often, but
certainly not worth the tribute of passion
and pain they obtain from foolish men like
yourself."</p>

<p>With this worldly wisdom Andrik de Morvan
had gone home, unconvinced. He loved
Ynys; and sophistries were an ineffectual
balm.</p>

<p>But as for Ynys, she had long made up her
mind. Betrothal or no betrothal, she belonged
now only to one man, and that man,
Alan de Kerival. She was his and his alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by every natural right. How could she help
the accident by which she had cared for
Andrik before she loved Alan? Now, indeed,
it would be sacrilege to be other than wholly
Alan's. Was her heart not his, and her life
with her heart, and with both her deathless
devotion?</p>

<p>Alan, she knew, trusted her absolutely.
Before he went back to Paris, after their love
was no longer a secret, he had never once
asked her to forfeit any thing of her intimacy
with Andrik, nor had he even urged the open
cancelling of the betrothal. But she was well
aware his own absolute loyalty involved for
him a like loyalty from her; and she knew
that forgiveness does not belong to those
natures which stake all upon a single die.</p>

<p>And so the matter stood thus still. Ynys
and Andrik de Morvan were nominally betrothed;
and not only the Marquis and the
Marquise de Kerival, but Andrik himself,
looked upon the bond as absolute.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lois de Kerival was not without
some suspicion as to how matters were
between the betrothed pair. Certainly she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
knew that Ynys was not one who would give
up any real or imagined happiness because of
a conventional arrangement or on account of
any conventional duty.</p>

<p>In Alan, Ynys found all that he found in
her. When she looked at him, she wondered
how she could ever have dreamed of Andrik
as a lover, for Alan was all that Andrik was
not. How proud and glad she felt because of
his great height and strength, his vivid features
with their gray-blue eyes and spirituel
expression, his wavy brown hair, a very
type of youthful and beautiful manhood!
Still more she revered and loved the inner
Alan whom she knew so well, and recognized
with a proud humility that this lover of hers,
whom the great Daniel Darc had spoken of as
a man of genius, was not only her knight, but
her comrade, her mate, her ideal.</p>

<p>Often the peasants of Kerival had speculated
if the young seigneur would join hands
with her or with Annaik. Some hoped the
one, some the other; but those who knew
Alan otherwise than merely by sight felt certain
that Ynys was the future bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are made for each other," old
Jeanne Mael, the village authority, was wont
to exclaim; "and the good God will bring
them together soon or late. 'Tis a fair, sweet
couple they are; none so handsome anywhere.
That tall, dark lass will be a good mother
when her hour comes; an' the child o' him
an' her should be the bonniest in the whole
wide world."</p>

<p>With that all who saw them together
agreed.</p>

<h3><a name="V" id="V">CHAPTER V</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE WALKER IN THE NIGHT</p>


<p>It was an hour from midnight when Alan
rose, opened a window, and looked out. The
storm was over. He could see the stars
glistening like silver fruit among the upper
branches of the elms. Behind the great
cypress known as the Fate of Kerival there
was a golden radiance, as though a disk of
radiant bronze were being slowly wheeled
round and round, invisible itself but casting a
quivering gleam upon the fibrous undersides
of the cypress spires. Soon the moon would
lift upward, and her paling gold become foam-white
along the wide reaches of the forest.</p>

<p>The wind had suddenly fallen. In this
abrupt lapse into silence there was something
mysterious. After so much violence, after
that wild, tempestuous cry, such stillness!
There was no more than a faint rustling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sound, as though invisible feet were stealthily
flying along the pathway of the upper boughs
and through the dim defiles in the dense
coverts of oak and beech in the very heart
of the woods. Only, from hitherward of the
unseen dunes floated a melancholy, sighing
refrain, the echo of the eddying sea-breath
among the pines. Beyond the last sands,
the deep, hollow boom of the sea itself.</p>

<p>To stay indoors seemed to Alan a wanton
forfeiture of beauty. The fragrance of the
forest intoxicated him. Spring was come, indeed.
This wild storm had ruined nothing,
for at its fiercest it had swept overhead; and
on the morrow the virginal green world would
be more beautiful than ever. Everywhere the
green fire of spring would be litten anew. A
green flame would pass from meadow to
hedgerow, from hedgerow to the tangled
thickets of bramble and dog-rose, from the
underwoods to the inmost forest glades.
Everywhere song would be to the birds,
everywhere young life would pulse, everywhere
the rhythm of a new rapture would run
rejoicing. The miracle of spring would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
accomplished in the sight of all men, of all
birds and beasts, of all green life. Each, in its
kind, would have a swifter throb in the red
blood or the vivid sap.</p>

<p>No, he could not wait. No, Alan added to
himself with a smile, not even though to sleep
in the House of Kerival was to be beneath the
same roof as Ynys&mdash;to be but a few yards, a
passage, a corridor away. Ah! for sure, he
could dream his dream as well out there
among the gleaming boughs, in the golden
sheen of the moon, under the stars. Was
there not the silence for deep peace, and the
voice of the unseen sea for echo to the deep
tides of love which surged obscurely in his
heart? Yes, he would go out to that beautiful
redemption of the night. How often, in
fevered Paris, he had known that healing,
either when his gaze was held by the quiet
stars, as he kept his hours-long vigil, or when
he escaped westward along the banks of the
Seine, and could wander undisturbed across
grassy spaces or under shadowy boughs!</p>

<p>In the great hall of the Manor he found
white-haired Matieu asleep in his wicker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
chair. The old man silently opened the
heavy oaken door, and, with a smile which
somewhat perplexed Alan, bowed to him as
he passed forth.</p>

<p>Could it be a space only of a few hours that
divided him from his recent arrival, he wondered.
The forest was no longer the same.
Then it was swept by the wind, lashed by the
rains, and was everywhere tortured into a
tempestuous music. Now it was so still,
save for a ceaseless faint dripping from wet
leaves and the conduits of a myriad sprays
and branches, that he could hear the occasional
shaking of the wings of hidden birds,
ruffling out their plumage because of the
moonlit quietudes that were come again.</p>

<p>And then, too, he had seen Ynys; had held
her hand in his; had looked in her beautiful,
hazel-green eyes, dusky and wonderful as a starlit
gloaming because of the depth of her dear
love; had pressed his lips to hers, and felt the
throbbing of her heart against his own. There,
in the forest-edge, it was difficult to realize
all this. It would be time to turn soon, to
walk back along the sycamore-margined Seine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
embankment, to reach the Tour de l'Ile and
be at his post in the observatory again. Then
he glanced backward, and saw a red light shining
from the room where the Marquis de
Kerival sat up late night after night, and he
wondered if Ynys were still there, or if she
were now in her room and asleep, or if she
lay in a waking dream.</p>

<p>For a time he stared at this beacon. Then,
troubled by many thoughts, but most by his
love, he moved slowly into one of the beech
avenues which radiated from the fantastic
mediæval sun-dial at the end of the tulip
garden in front of the château.</p>

<p>While the moon slowly lifted from branch to
branch a transient stir of life came into the
forest.</p>

<p>Here and there he heard low cries, sometimes
breaking into abrupt eddies of arrested
song; thrushes, he knew, ever swift to slide
their music out against any tide of light. Once
or twice a blackcap, in one of the beeches
near the open, sang so poignantly a brief
strain that he thought it that of a nightingale.
Later, in an oak glade, he heard the unmistakable
song itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea sound came hollowly under the
boughs like a spent billow. Instinctively he
turned that way, and so crossed a wide glade
that opened on the cypress alley to the west
of the château.</p>

<p>Just as he emerged upon this glade he
thought he saw a stooping figure glide swiftly
athwart the northern end of it and disappear
among the cypresses. Startled, he stood still.</p>

<p>No one stirred. Nothing moved. He
could hear no sound save the faint sighing of
the wind-eddy among the pines, the dull
rhythmic beat of the sea falling heavily upon
the sands.</p>

<p>"It must have been a delusion," he muttered.
Yet, for the moment, he had felt certain
that the crouching figure of a man had
moved swiftly out of the shadow of the solitary
wide-spreading thorn he knew so well,
and had disappeared into the darker shadow
of the cypress alley.</p>

<p>After all, what did it matter? It could
only be some poor fellow poaching. With a
smile, Alan remembered how often he had
sinned likewise. He would listen, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and give the man a fright, for he knew that
Tristran de Kerival was stern in his resentment
against poachers, partly because he was
liberal in certain woodland-freedom he
granted, on the sole condition that none of
the peasants ever came within the home
domain.</p>

<p>Soon, however, he was convinced that he
was mistaken. Deep silence prevailed everywhere.
Almost, he fancied, he could hear
the soft fall of the dew. A low whirring
sound showed that a night-jar had already
begun his summer wooing. Now that, as he
knew from Ynys, the cuckoo was come, and
that the swallows had suddenly multiplied
from a score of pioneers into a battalion of
ever-flying darts; now that he had listened to
the nightingales calling through the moonlit
woods and had heard the love-note of the
night-jar, the hot weather must be come at
last&mdash;that glorious tide of golden life which
flows from April to June and makes them the
joy of the world.</p>

<p>Slowly he walked across the glade. At the
old thorn he stopped, and leaned a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
against its rugged, twisted bole, recalling incident
after incident associated with it.</p>

<p>It was strangely restful there. Around him
was the quiet sea of moonlight; yonder,
behind the cypresses and the pine-crowned
dunes, was the quiet sea of moving waters;
yet, in the one, there was scarce less of
silence than in the other. Ah! he remembered
abruptly, on just such a night, years
ago, he and Annaik had stood long there,
hand in hand, listening to a nightingale.
What a strange girl she was, even then!
Well he recalled how, at the end of the song
and when the little brown singer had slipped
from its bough, like a stone slung from a
sling, Annaik had laughed, though he knew
not at what, and had all at once unfastened
her hair, and let its tawny bronze-red mass
fall about her shoulders. She was so beautiful
and wild that he had clasped her in his
arms, and had kissed her again and again. And
Annaik ... oh, he remembered, half shyly,
half exultantly ... she had laughed again,
but more low, and had tied the long drifts of
her hair around his neck like a blood-red scarf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>It gave him a strange emotion to recall all
this. Did Annaik also think of it ever, he
wondered? Then, too, had they not promised
somewhat to each other? Yes ...
Annaik had said: "One night we shall come
here again, and then, if you do not love me
as much as you do now, I shall strangle you
with my hair: and if you love me more we
shall go away into the forest, and never return,
or not for long, long; but if you do not
love me at all, then you are to tell me so,
and I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" he had asked, when she stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>At that, however, she had said no more as
to what was in her mind, but had asked him
to carve upon the thorn the "A" of her name
and the "A" of his into a double "A." Yes,
of course, he had done this. Where was it? he
pondered. Surely midway on the southward
side, for then as now the moonlight would be
there.</p>

<p>With an eagerness of which he was conscious
he slipped from where he leaned, and examined
the bole of the tree. A heavy branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
intervened. This he caught and withheld,
and the light flooded upon the gnarled trunk.</p>

<p>With a start, Alan almost relinquished the
branch. There, unmistakable, was a large
carven "A," but not only was it the old double
"A" made into a single letter, but clearly
the change had been made quite recently,
apparently within a few hours. Moreover, it
was now linked to another letter. The legend
ran: "<i>A &amp; J</i>."</p>

<p>Puzzled, he looked close. There could be
no mistake. The cutting was recent. The
"<i>J</i>," indeed, might have been that moment
done. Suddenly an idea flashed into his mind.
He stooped and examined the mossed roots.
Yes, there were the fragments. He took one
and put it between his teeth; the wood was
soft, and had the moisture of fibre recently
severed.</p>

<p>Who was "J"? Alan pondered over every
name he could think of. He knew no one
whose baptismal name began thus, with the
exception of Jervaise de Morvan, the brother
of Andrik, and he was married and resident
in distant Pondicherry. Otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
there was but Jak Bourzak, the woodcutter&mdash;a
bent, broken-down old man who could not
have cut the letters for the good reason that
he was unable to write and was so ignorant
that, even in that remote region, he was called
Jak the Stupid. Alan was still pondering over
this when suddenly the stillness was broken
by the loud screaming of peacocks.</p>

<p>Kerival was famous for these birds, of
which the peasantry stood in superstitious
awe. Indeed, a legend was current to the
effect that Tristran de Kerival maintained
those resplendent creatures because they were
the souls of his ancestors, or such of them as
before death had not been able to gain absolution
for their sins. When they were heard
crying harshly before rain or at sundown,
or sometimes in the moonlight, the hearers
shuddered. "The lost souls of Kerival" became
a saying, and there were prophets here
and there who foreboded ill for Tristran the
Silent, or some one near and dear to him,
whenever that strange clamor rang forth
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Alan himself was surprised, startled. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
night was so still, no further storm was imminent,
and the moon had been risen for some
time. Possibly the peacocks had strolled into
the cypress alley, to strut to and fro in the
moonshine, as their wont was in their wooing
days, and two of them had come into jealous
dispute.</p>

<p>Still that continuous harsh tumult seemed
rather to have the note of alarm than
of quarrel. Alan walked to the seaward
side of the thorn, but still kept within its
shadow.</p>

<p>The noise was now not only clamant but
startling. The savage screaming, like that of
barbaric trumpets, filled the night.</p>

<p>Swiftly the listener crossed the glade, and
was soon among the cypresses. There, while
the dull thud of the falling seas was more than
ever audible, the screams of the peacocks were
so insistent that he had ears for these alone.</p>

<p>At the eastern end of the alley the glade
broke away into scattered pines, and from
these swelled a series of low dunes. Alan
could see them clearly from where he stood,
under the boughs of a huge yew, one of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
that grew here and there among their solemn,
columnar kin.</p>

<p>His gaze was upon this open space when,
abruptly, he started. A tall, slim figure,
coming from the shore, moved slowly inland
across the dunes.</p>

<p>Who could this walker in the dark be?
The shadowy Walker in the Night herself,
mayhap; the dreaded soulless woman who
wanders at dead of night through forests, or
by desolate shores, or by the banks of the
perilous <i>marais</i>.</p>

<p>Often he had heard of her. When any man
met this woman, his fate depended on whether
he saw her before she caught sight of him.
If she saw him first, she had but to sing her
wild, strange song, and he would have to go
to her; and when he was before her two
flames would come out of her eyes, and one
flame would burn up his life as though it were
dry tinder, and the other would wrap round
his soul like a scarlet shawl, and she would
take it and live with it in a cavern underground
for a year and a day. And on that
last day she would let it go, as a hare is let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
go a furlong beyond a greyhound. Then it
would fly like a windy shadow from glade to
glade or from dune to dune, in the vain hope
to reach a wayside Calvary; but ever in vain.
Sometimes the Holy Tree would almost be
reached; then, with a gliding swiftness, like
a flood racing down a valley, the Walker in
the Night would be alongside the fugitive.
Now and again unhappy night-farers&mdash;unhappy
they, for sure, for never does weal
remain with any one who hears what no human
ear should hearken&mdash;would be startled by
a sudden laughing in the darkness. This was
when some such terrible chase had happened,
and when the creature of the night had taken
the captive soul, in the last moments of the
last hour of the last day of its possible redemption,
and rent it this way and that, as a hawk
scatters the feathered fragments of its
mutilated quarry.</p>

<p>Alan thought of this wild legend, and
shuddered. Years ago he had been foolhardy
enough to wish to meet the phantom, to see
her before she saw him, and to put a spell
upon her. For, if this were possible, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
compel her to whisper some of her secret lore,
and she could give him spells to keep him
scathless till old age.</p>

<p>But as, with fearful gaze, he stared at the
figure which so leisurely moved toward the
cypress alley, he was puzzled by some vague
resemblance, by something familiar. The
figure was that of a woman, unmistakably;
and she moved as though she were in a
dream.</p>

<p>But who could it be, there, in that lonely
place, at that hour of the night? Who would
venture or care....</p>

<p>In a flash all was clear. It was Annaik!</p>

<p>There was no room for doubt. He might
have known her lithe walk, her wildwood
grace, her peculiar carriage; but before
recognition of these had come, he had caught
a glimpse of her hair in the moonlight. It
was like burnished brass, in that yellow shine.
There was no other such hair in the world, he
believed.</p>

<p>But ... Annaik! What could she be
doing there? How had she been able to leave
the château; when had she stolen forth; where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
had she wandered; whither was she going; to
what end?</p>

<p>These and other thoughts stormed through
Alan's mind. Almost&mdash;he muttered below his
breath&mdash;almost he would rather have seen the
Walker in the Night.</p>

<p>As she drew nearer he could see her as
clearly as though it were daylight. She
appeared to be thinking deeply, and ever and
again be murmuring disconnected phrases.
His heart smote him when he saw her, twice,
raise her arms and then wring her hands as if
in sore straits of sorrow.</p>

<p>He did not stir. He would wait, he thought.
It might add to Annaik's strange grief, if
grief it were, to betray his presence. Again,
was it possible that she was there to meet
some one&mdash;to encounter the "J" whose
initial was beside her own on the old thorn?
How pale she was! he noticed. A few yards
away her dress caught; she hesitated, slowly
disengaged herself, but did not advance again.
For the third time she wrung her hands.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Alan was about to
move forward when he heard her voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Alan, Alan, Alan!"</p>

<p>What ... had she seen him? He flushed
there in the shadow, and words rose to his
lips. Then he was silent, for she spoke again:</p>

<p>"I hate her ... I hate her ... not
for herself, no, no, no ... but because
she has taken you from me. Why does Ynys
have you, all of you, when I have loved you all
along? None of us knew any thing&mdash;none,
till last Noël. Then we knew; only, neither
you nor Ynys knew that I loved you as a soul
in hell loves the memory of its earthly joy."</p>

<p>Strange words, there in that place, at that
hour; but far stranger the passionless voice
in which the passionate words were uttered.
Bewildered, Alan leaned forward, intent.
The words had waned to a whisper, but were
now incoherent. Fragmentary phrases, irrelevant
words, what could it all mean?</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea made him start. He
moved slightly, so as to catch the full
flood of a moonbeam as it fell on Annaik's
face.</p>

<p>Yes, he was right. Her eyes were open,
but were fixed in an unseeing stare. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the first time, too, he noted that she was
clad simply in a long dressing-gown. Her
feet were bare, and were glistening with the
wet they had gathered; on her lustrous hair,
nothing but the moonlight.</p>

<p>He had remembered. Both Annaik and
Ynys had a tendency to somnambulism, a trait
inherited from their father. It had been
cured years ago, he had understood. But
here&mdash;here was proof that Annaik at any rate
was still subject to that mysterious malady of
sleep.</p>

<p>That she was absolutely trance-bound he
saw clearly. But what he should do&mdash;that
puzzled, that bewildered him.</p>

<p>Slowly Annaik, after a brief hesitancy when
he fancied she was about to awake, moved forward
again.</p>

<p>She came so close that almost she brushed
against him; would have done so, indeed, but
that he was hidden from contact as well as
from sight by the boughs of the yew, which on
that side swept to the ground.</p>

<p>Alan put out his hand. Then he withdrew
it. No, he thought, he would let her go unmolested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and, if possible, unawaked: but he
would follow her, lest evil befell. She passed.
His nerves thrilled. What was this strange
emotion, that gave him a sensation almost as
though he had seen his own wraith? But different ... for,
oh&mdash;he could not wait to
think about that, he muttered.</p>

<p>He was about to stoop and emerge from the
yew-boughs when he heard a sound which
made him stop abruptly.</p>

<p>It was a step; of that he felt sure. And at
hand, too. The next moment he was glad he
had not disclosed himself, for a crouching
figure stealthily followed Annaik.</p>

<p>Surely that was the same figure he had seen
cross the glade, the figure that had slipped
from the thorn?</p>

<p>If so, could it be the person who had cut the
letter "J" on the bark of the tree? The man
kept so much in the shadow that it was difficult
to obtain a glimpse of his face. Alan waited.
In a second or two he would have to pass the
yew.</p>

<p>Just before the mysterious pursuer reached
the old tree, he stopped. Alan furtively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
glanced to his left. He saw that Annaik had
suddenly halted. She stood intent, as though
listening. Possibly she had awaked. He
saw her lips move. She spoke, or called
something; what, he could not hear because of
the intermittent screaming of the peacocks.</p>

<p>When he looked at the man in the shadow
he started. A moonbeam had penetrated the
obscurity, and the face was white against the
black background of a cypress.</p>

<p>Alan recognized the man in a moment. It
was Jud Kerbastiou, the forester. What ...
was it possible: could <i>he</i> be the "J" who had
linked his initial with that of Annaik?</p>

<p>It was incredible. The man was not only a
boor, but one with rather an ill repute. At
any rate, he was known to be a poacher as
well as a woodlander of the old Breton kind&mdash;men
who would never live save in the forest,
any more than a gypsy would become a clerk
and live in a street.</p>

<p>It was said among the peasants of Kerival
that his father, old Iouenn Kerbastiou, the
charcoal burner, was an illegitimate brother
of the late Marquis&mdash;so that Jud, or Judik, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
he was generally called, was a blood-relation
of the great folk at the château. Once this
had been hinted to the Marquis Tristran. It
was for the first and last time. Since then,
Jud Kerbastiou had become more morose
than ever, and was seldom seen among his
fellows. When not with his infirm old father,
at the hut in the woods that were to the eastward
of the forest-hamlet of Ploumael, he was
away in the densely wooded reaches to the
south. Occasionally he was seen upon the
slopes of the Black Hills, but this was only
in winter, when he crossed over into Upper
Brittany with a mule-train laden with cut
fagots.</p>

<p>That he was prowling about the home
domain of Kerival was itself ominous; but
that in this stealthy manner he should be
following Annaik was to Allan a matter of
genuine alarm. Surely the man could mean
no evil against one of the Big House, and
one, too, so much admired, and in a certain
way loved, as Annaik de Kerival? And yet,
the stealthy movements of the peasant, his
crouching gait, his patient dogging of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
steps&mdash;and this, doubtless, ever since <i>she</i>
had crossed the glade from the forest to
the cypresses&mdash;all this had a menacing
aspect.</p>

<p>At that moment the peacocks ceased their
wild miaulling. Low and clear, Annaik's
voice same thrillingly along the alley:</p>

<p>"<i>Alan! Alan! Oh, Alan, darling, are you
there?</i>"</p>

<p>His heart beat. Then a flush sprang to his
brow, as with sudden anger he heard Jud
Kerbastiou reply, in a thick, muffled tone:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, ... and, and I love you,
Annaik!"</p>

<p>Possibly the sleeper heard and understood.
Even at that distance Alan saw the light upon
her face, the light from within.</p>

<p>Judik the peasant slowly advanced. His
stealthy tread was light as that of a fox. He
stopped when he was within a yard of Annaik.
"Annaik," he muttered hoarsely, "Annaik,
it was I who was out among the beeches in
front of the château while the storm was raging.
Sure you must have known it; else, why
would you come out? I love you, white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
woman. I am only a peasant ... but I
love you, Annaik de Kerival, I love you&mdash;I
love you&mdash;I love you!"</p>

<p>Surely she was on the verge of waking!
The color had come back to her white face,
her lips moved, as though stirred by a breath
from within. Her hands were clasped, and
the fingers intertwisted restlessly.</p>

<p>Kerbastiou was so wrought that he did not
hear steps behind him as Alan moved swiftly
forward.</p>

<p>"Sure, you will be mine at last," the man
cried hoarsely, "mine, and none to dispute
... ay, and this very night, too."</p>

<p>Slowly Jud put out an arm. His hand
almost touched that of Annaik. Suddenly he
was seized from behind, and a hand was
claspt firmly upon his mouth. He did not
see who his unexpected assailant was, but
he heard the whisper that was against his
ear:</p>

<p>"If you make a sound, I will strangle you
to death."</p>

<p>With a nod, he showed that he understood.
"If I let go for the moment, will you come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
back under the trees here, where she cannot
see or hear us?"</p>

<p>Another nod.</p>

<p>Alan relaxed his hold, but did not wholly
relinquish his grip. Kerbastiou turned and
looked at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's <i>you</i>!" he muttered, as he followed
his assailant into the shadow some yards back.</p>

<p>"Yes, Judik Kerbastiou, it is I, Alan de
Kerival."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"What do I want? How dare you be so
insolent, fellow? you, who have been following
a defenceless woman!"</p>

<p>"What have <i>you</i> been doing?"</p>

<p>"I ... oh, of course I have been following
Mlle. Annaik also ... but that was ... that
was ... to protect her."</p>

<p>"And is it not possible I might follow her
for the same reason?"</p>

<p>"It is not the same thing at all, Judik Kerbastiou,
and you know it. In the first place
you have no right to be here at all. In the
next, I am Mlle. Annaik's cousin, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I am her lover."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Alan stared at the man in sheer amaze.
He spoke quietly and assuredly, nor seemed
in the least degree perturbed.</p>

<p>"But ... but ... why, Kerbastiou, it
is impossible!"</p>

<p>"What is impossible?"</p>

<p>"That Annaik could love <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"I did not say she loved me. I said I was
her lover."</p>

<p>"And you believe that you, a peasant, a
man held in ill repute even among your fellow-peasants,
a homeless woodlander, can gain the
love of the daughter of your seigneur, of a
woman nurtured as she has been?"</p>

<p>"You speak like a book, as the saying is,
M. de Kerival." Judik uttered the words
mockingly, and with raised voice. Annaik,
who was still standing as one entranced,
heard it: for she whispered again, "<i>Alan!
Alan! Alan!</i>"</p>

<p>"Hush, man! she will hear. Listen,
Judik, I don't want to speak harshly. You
know me. Every one here does. You must
be well aware that I am the last person to
despise you or any man because you are poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and unfortunate. But you <i>must</i> see that such
a love as this of yours is madness."</p>

<p>"All love is madness."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; of course! But look you, Judik,
what right have you to be here at all, in the
home domain, in the dead of night?"</p>

<p>"You love Ynys de Kerival?"</p>

<p>"Yes ... well, yes, I do love her; but
what then? What is that to you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I love Annaik. I am here by the
same right as you are."</p>

<p>"You forget. <i>I</i> am welcome. You come
by stealth. Do you mean for a moment to say
that you are here to meet Mlle. Annaik by
appointment?"</p>

<p>The man was silent.</p>

<p>"Judik Kerbastiou!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You are a coward. You followed this
woman whom you say you love with intent to
rob her."</p>

<p>"You are a fool, Alan de Kerival."</p>

<p>Alan raised his arm. Then, ashamed, he let
it fall.</p>

<p>"Will you go? Will you go now, at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
or shall I wake Mlle. Annaik, and tell her
what I have seen&mdash;and from what I believe I
have saved her?"</p>

<p>"No, you need not wake her, nor tell her
any thing. I know she has never even given
me a thought."</p>

<p>Suddenly the man bowed his head. A sob
burst through the dark.</p>

<p>Alan put his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Judik! Judik Kerbastiou! I am sorry
for you from my heart. But go ... go now,
at once. Nothing shall be said of this. No
one shall know any thing. If you wish me
to tell my cousin, I will. Then she can see
you or not, as she may wish."</p>

<p>"I go. But ... yes, tell her. To-morrow.
Tell her to-morrow. Only I would not have
hurt her. Tell her that. I go now. <i>Adiou.</i>"</p>

<p>With that Judik Kerbastiou lifted his
shaggy head, and turned his great black,
gypsy-wild eyes upon Alan.</p>

<p>"She loves <i>you</i>," he said simply. Then he
stepped lightly over the path, passed between
the cypresses, and moved out across the glade.
Alan watched his dark figure slide through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the moonlight. He traversed the glade to the
right of the thorn. For nearly half a mile he was
visible; then he turned and entered the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later two figures moved, in absolute
silence, athwart the sand-dunes beyond the
cypress alley.</p>

<p>Hand in hand they moved. Their faces
were in deep shadow, for the moonlight was
now obscured by a league-long cloud.</p>

<p>When they emerged from the scattered pines
to the seaward of the château, the sentinel
peacocks saw them, and began once more
their harsh, barbaric screams.</p>

<p>The twain unclasped their hands, and
walked steadily forward, speaking no word,
not once looking one at the other.</p>

<p>As they entered the yew-close at the end of
the old garden of the château they were as
shadows drowned in night. For some minutes
they were invisible; though, from above, the
moon shone upon their white faces and on
their frozen stillness. The peacocks sullenly
ceased.</p>

<p>Once more they emerged into the moon-dusk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
As they neared the ivied gables of the
west wing of the Manor the cloud drifted
from the moon, and her white flood turned
the obscurity into a radiance wherein every
object stood forth as clear as at noon.</p>

<p>Alan's face was white as are the faces of the
dead. His eyes did not once lift from the
ground. But in Annaik's face was a flush,
and her eyes were wild and beautiful as falling
stars.</p>

<p>It was not an hour since she had wakened
from her trance; not an hour, and yet already
had Alan forgotten&mdash;forgotten her, and Ynys,
and the storm, and the after calm. Of one
thing he thought only, and that was of what
Daniel Darc had once said to him laughingly:
"If the old fables of astrology were true, your
horoscope would foretell impossible things."</p>

<p>In absolute silence they moved up the long
flight of stone stairs that led to the château;
in absolute silence, they entered by the door
which old Matieu had left ajar; in silence, they
passed that unconscious sleeper; in silence,
they crossed the landing where the corridors
diverged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Both stopped, simultaneously. Alan
seemed about to speak, but his lips closed
again without utterance.</p>

<p>Abruptly he turned. Without a word he
passed along the corridor to the right, and
disappeared in the obscurity.</p>

<p>Annaik stood a while, motionless, silent.
Then she put her hand to her heart. On her
impassive face the moonlight revealed nothing;
only in her eyes there was a gleam as of
one glad unto death.</p>

<p>Then she too passed, noiseless and swift as
a phantom. Outside, on the stone terrace,
Ys, the blind peacock, strode to and fro,
uttering his prolonged, raucous screams.
When, at last, he was unanswered by the peacocks
in the cypress alley, his clamant voice
no longer tore the silence.</p>

<p>The moon trailed her flood of light across
the earth. It lay upon the waters, and was
still a glory there when, through the chill
quietudes of dawn, the stars waned one by
one in the soft graying that filtered through
the morning dusk. The new day was come.</p>

<h3><a name="VI" id="VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h3>

<p class="center">VIA OSCURA</p>


<p>The day that followed this quiet dawn
marked the meridian of spring. Thereafter
the flush upon the blossoms would deepen;
the yellow pass out of the green; and a
deeper green involve the shoreless emerald
sea of verdure which everywhere covered the
brown earth, and swelled and lapsed in endlessly
receding billows of forest and woodland.
Up to that noon-tide height Spring
had aspired, ever since she had shaken the
dust of snow from her primrose-sandals; now,
looking upon the way she had come, she took
the hand of Summer&mdash;and both went forth as
one, so that none should tell which was still
the guest of the greenness.</p>

<p>This was the day when Alan and Ynys
walked among the green alleys of the woods
of Kerival, and when, through the deep gladness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that was his for all the strange, gnawing
pain in his mind, in his ears echoed the haunting
line of Rimbaud, "Then, in the violet
forest all a-bourgeon, Eucharis said to me:
'It is Spring.'"</p>

<p>Through the first hours of the day Alan
had been unwontedly silent. Ynys had
laughed at him with loving eyes, but had not
shown any shadow of resentment. His word
to the effect that his journey had tired him,
and that he had not slept at all, was enough
to account for his lack of buoyant joy.</p>

<p>But, in truth, Ynys did not regret this,
since it had brought a still deeper intensity
of love into Alan's eyes. When he looked at
her, there was so much passion of longing, so
pathetic an appeal, that her heart smote her.
Why should she be the one chosen to evoke a
love such as this, she wondered; she, who was
but Ynys, while Alan was a man whom all
women might love, and had genius that made
him as one set apart from his fellows, and was
brow-lit by a starry fate?</p>

<p>And yet, in a sense she understood. They
were so much at one, so like in all essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
matters, and were in all ways comrades. It
would have been impossible for each not to
love the other. But, deeper than this, was
the profound and intimate communion of the
spirit. In some beautiful, strange way, she
knew she was the flame to his fire. At that
flame he lit the torch of which Daniel Darc
and others had spoken. She did not see why
or wherein it was so, but she believed, and
indeed at last realized the exquisite actuality.</p>

<p>In deep love, there is no height nor depth
between two hearts, no height nor depth,
no length nor breadth. There is simply
love.</p>

<p>The birds of Angus Ogue are like the wild-doves
of the forest: when they nest in the
heart they are as one. And her life, and
Alan's, were not these one?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ynys was disappointed as the
day went on, and her lover did not seem able
to rouse himself from his strange despondency.</p>

<p>Doubtless this was due largely to what was
pending. That afternoon he was to have his
long anticipated interview with the Marquise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
and would perhaps learn what might affect his
whole life. On the other hand, each believed
that nothing would be revealed which was not
of the past solely.</p>

<p>Idly, Ynys began to question her companion
about the previous night. What had
he done, since he had not slept; had he read,
or dreamed at the window, or gone out, as
had once been his wont on summer nights, to
walk in the cypress alley or along the grassy
dunes? Had he heard a nightingale singing
in the moonlight? Had he noticed the prolonged
screaming of the peacocks&mdash;unusually
prolonged, now that she thought of it, Ynys
added.</p>

<p>"I wonder, dear, if you would love me
whatever happened&mdash;whatever I was, or did?"</p>

<p>It was an inconsequent question. She
looked up at him, half perturbed, half
pleased.</p>

<p>"Yes, Alan."</p>

<p>"But do you mean what you say, knowing
that you are not only using a phrase?"</p>

<p>"I have no gift of expression, dearest.
Words come to me without their bloom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
their fragrance, I often think. But ...
Alan, <i>I love you</i>."</p>

<p>"That is sweetest music for me, Ynys, my
fawn. All words from you have both bloom
and fragrance, though you may not know it,
shy flower. But tell me again, do you mean
what you say, <i>absolutely</i>?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. In every way, in all things, at
all times. Dear, how could <i>any thing</i> come between
us? It is <i>possible</i>, of course, that circumstances
might separate us. But nothing could
really come between us. My heart is yours."</p>

<p>"What about Andrik de Morvan?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you are not in earnest, Alan!"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am more than half in earnest,
Ynys, darling. Tell me!"</p>

<p>"You cannot possibly believe that I care,
that I could care, for Andrik as I care for
you, Alan."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Oh, have you so little belief,
then, in women&mdash;in me? Alan, do you not
know that what is perhaps possible for a man,
though I cannot conceive it, is <i>impossible</i> for a
woman. That is the poorest sophistry which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
says a woman may love two men at the same
time. That is, if by love is meant what you
and I mean. Affection, the deepest affection,
is one thing; the love of man and woman, as
<i>we</i> mean it, is a thing apart!"</p>

<p>"You love Andrik?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you wed your life with his?"</p>

<p>"I could have done so ... but for you."</p>

<p>"Then, by your true heart, is there no
possibility that he can in any way ever come
between us?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Although he is nominally your betrothed,
and believes in you as his future wife?"</p>

<p>"That is not my fault. I drifted into that
conditional union, as you know. But after
to-day he and every one shall know that I
can wed no man but you. But why do you
ask me these things, Alan?"</p>

<p>"I want to know. I will explain later.
But tell me; could you be happy with Andrik?
You say you love him?"</p>

<p>"I love him as a friend, as a comrade."</p>

<p>"As an intimately dear comrade?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alan, do not let us misunderstand each
other. There can only be one supreme comrade
for a woman, and that is the man whom
she loves supremely. Every other affection,
the closest, the dearest, is as distinct from
that as day from night."</p>

<p>"If by some malign chance you and Andrik
married&mdash;say, in the event of my supposed
death&mdash;would you still be as absolutely true
to me as you are now?"</p>

<p>"What has the accident of marriage to do
with truth between a man and a woman,
Alan?"</p>

<p>"It involves intimacies that would be a
desecration otherwise. Oh, Ynys, do you
not understand?"</p>

<p>"It is a matter of the inner life. Men so
rarely believe in the hidden loyalty of the
heart. It is possible for a woman to fulfil a
bond and yet not be a bondswoman. Outer
circumstances have little to do with the inner
life, with the real self."</p>

<p>"In a word, then, if you married Andrik
you would remain absolutely mine, not only
if I were dead, but if perchance the rumor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
were untrue and I came back, though too
late?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Absolutely?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"And you profoundly know, Ynys, that in
no conceivable circumstances can Andrik be
to you what I am, or any thing for a moment
approaching it?"</p>

<p>"I do know it."</p>

<p>"Although he were your husband?"</p>

<p>"Although he were my husband."</p>

<p>The worn lines that were in Alan's face
were almost gone. Looking into his eyes
Ynys saw that the strange look of pain which
had alarmed her was no longer there. The
dear eyes had brightened; a new hope seemed
to have arisen in them.</p>

<p>"Do you believe me, Alan, dear?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"If I did not, it would kill me, Ynys."</p>

<p>And he spoke truth. The bitter sophistications
of love play lightly with the possibilities
of death. Men who talk of suicide are likely to
be long-livers; lovers whose hearts are easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
broken can generally recover and astonish
themselves by their heroic endurance. The
human heart is like a wave of the sea; it can
be lashed into storm, it can be calmed, it can
become stagnant&mdash;but it is seldom absorbed
from the ocean till in natural course the sun
takes up its spirit in vapor. Yet, ever and
again, there is one wave among a myriad
which a spiral wind-eddy may suddenly strike.
In a moment it is whirled this way and that; it
is involved in a cataclysm of waters; and then
cloud and sea meet, and what a moment before
had been an ocean wave is become an
idle skyey vapor.</p>

<p>Alan was of the few men of whom that
wave is the symbol. To him, death could
come at any time, if the wind-eddy of a certain
unthinkable sorrow struck him at his
heart.</p>

<p>In this sense, his life was in Ynys's hands
as absolutely as though he were a caged bird.
He knew it, and Ynys knew it.</p>

<p>There are a few men, a few women, like this.
Perhaps it is well that these are so rare.
Among the hills of the north, at least, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
may still be found; in remote mountain
valleys and in lonely isles, where life and
death are realized actualities and not the mere
adumbrations of the pinions of that lonely
fugitive, the human mind, along the endless
precipices of Time.</p>

<p>Alan knew well that both he and Ynys were
not so strong as each believed. Knowing
this, he feared for both. And yet, there was
but one woman in the world for him&mdash;Ynys;
as for her, there was but one man&mdash;Alan.
Without her, he could do nothing, achieve
nothing. She was his flame, his inspiration,
his strength, his light. Without her, he was
afraid to live; with her, death was a beautiful
dream. To her, Alan was not less. She
lived in him and for him.</p>

<p>But we are wrought of marsh-fire as well as
of stellar light. Now, as of old, the gods do
not make of the fairest life a thornless rose.
A single thorn may innocently convey poison;
so that everywhere men and women go to and
fro perilously, and not least those who move
through the shadow and shine of an imperious
passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>For a time, thereafter, Alan and Ynys
walked slowly onward, hand in hand, each
brooding deep over the thoughts their words
had stirred.</p>

<p>"Do you know what Yann says, Alan?"
Ynys asked in a low voice, after both had
stopped instinctively to listen to a thrush
leisurely iterating his just learned love carol,
where he swung on a greening spray of honeysuckle
under a yellow-green lime. "Do you
know what Yann says?... He says that you
have a wave at your feet. What does that
mean?"</p>

<p>"When did he tell you that, Ynys, mo-chree?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Alan, dear, how sweet it is to hear
from your lips the dear Gaelic we both love so
well! And does that not make you more than
ever anxious to learn all that you are to hear
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes ... but that, that Ian Macdonald
said; what else did he say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. He would say no more. I
asked him in the Gaelic, and he repeated only,
'I see a wave at his feet.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"What Ian means by that I know well. It
means I am going on a far journey."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Alan, no!"</p>

<p>"He has the sight upon him, at times. Ian
would not say that thing, did he not mean it.
Tell me, my fawn, has he ever said any thing
of this kind about <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Less than a month ago. I was with
him one day on the dunes near the sea. Once,
when he gave no answer to what I asked, I
looked at him, and saw his eyes fixt. 'What
do you see, Yann?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I see great rocks, strange caverns. Sure,
it is well I am knowing what they are. They
are the Sea-caves of Rona.'</p>

<p>"There were no rocks visible from where
we stood, so I knew that Ian was in one of his
visionary moods. I waited, and then spoke
again, whisperingly:</p>

<p>"'Tell me, Ian MacIain, what do you see?'</p>

<p>"'I see two whom I do not know. And
they are in a strange place, they are. And on
the man I see a shadow, and on the woman I
see a light. But what that shadow is, I do not
know; nor do I know what that light is. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
I am for thinking that it is of the Virgin Mary,
for I see the dream that is in the woman's
heart, and it is a fair wonderful dream <i>that</i>.'</p>

<p>"That is all Yann said, Alan. As I was
about to speak, his face changed.</p>

<p>"'What is it, Ian?' I asked.</p>

<p>"At first he would answer nothing. Then
he said: 'It is a dream. It means nothing.
It was only because I was thinking of you and
Alan MacAlasdair.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ynys!"&mdash;Alan interrupted with an
eager cry&mdash;"that is a thing I have long striven
to know; that which lies in the words 'Alan
MacAlasdair.' My father, then, was named
Alasdair! And was it Rona, you said, was
the place of the Sea-caves? Rona ... that
must be an island. The only Rona I know
of is that near Skye. It may be the same.
Now, indeed, I have a clew, lest I should
learn nothing to-day. Did Ian say nothing
more?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I asked him if the man and
woman he saw were you and I, but he would
not speak. I am certain he was about to say
yes, but refrained."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>For a while they walked on in silence, each
revolving many speculations aroused by the
clew given by the words of "Yann the Dumb."
Suddenly Ynys tightened her clasp of Alan's
hand.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Alan, some time ago you asked me
abruptly what I knew about the forester, Judik
Kerbastiou. Well, I see him in that beech-covert
yonder, looking at us."</p>

<p>Alan started. Ynys noticed that for a
moment he grew pale as foam. His lips
parted, as though he were about to call to the
woodlander: when Judik advanced, making at
the same time a sign of silence.</p>

<p>The man had a wild look about him.
Clearly, he had not slept since he and Alan had
parted at midnight. His dusky eyes had a red
light in them. His rough clothes were still
damp; his face, too, was strangely white and
dank.</p>

<p>Alan presumed that he came to say something
concerning Annaik. He did not know what
to do to prevent this, but while he was pondering,
Judik spoke in a hoarse, tired voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let the Lady Ynys go back to the château
at once. She is needed there."</p>

<p>"Why, what is wrong, Judik Kerbastiou?"</p>

<p>"Let her go back, I say. No time for
words now. Be quick. I am not deceiving
you. Listen ..." and with that he leaned
toward Alan, and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>Alan looked at him with startled amaze.
Then, turning toward Ynys, he asked her to
go back at once to the château.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="VII" id="VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h3>

<p class="center">"DEIREADH GACH COGAIDH, SITH" (THE
END OF ALL WARFARE, PEACE)</p>


<p>Alan did not wait till Ynys was out of
sight, before he demanded the reason of
Judik's strange appearance and stranger summons.</p>

<p>"Why are you here again, Judik Kerbastiou?
What is the meaning of this haunting
of the forbidden home domain? And what
did you mean by urging Mlle. Ynys to go
back at once to the château?"</p>

<p>"Time enough later for your other questions,
young sir. Meanwhile come along with
me, and as quick as you can."</p>

<p>Without another word the woodlander
turned and moved rapidly along a narrow path
through the brushwood.</p>

<p>Alan saw it would be useless to ask further
questions at the moment; moreover, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
now vaguely alarmed. What could all this
mystery mean? Could an accident have
happened to the Marquis Tristran? It was
hardly likely, for he seldom ventured into the
forest, unless when the weather had dried all
the ways: for he had to be wheeled in his
chair, and, as Alan knew, disliked to leave the
gardens or the well-kept yew and cypress
alleys near the château.</p>

<p>In a brief while, however, he heard voices.
Judik turned, and waved to him to be wary.
The forester bent forward, stared intently,
and then beckoned to Alan to creep up alongside.</p>

<p>"Who is it? What is it, Judik?"</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>Alan disparted a bough of underwood which
made an effectual screen. In the glade beyond
were four figures.</p>

<p>One of these he recognized at once. It
was the Marquis de Kerival. He was, as
usual, seated in his wheeled chair. Behind
him, some paces to the right, was Raif Kermorvan,
the steward of Kerival. The other
two men Alan had not seen before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>One of these strangers was a tall, handsome
man, of about sixty. His close-cropped white
hair, his dress, his whole mien, betrayed the
military man. Evidently a colonel, Alan
thought, or perhaps a general; at any rate an
officer of high rank, and one to whom command
and self-possession were alike habitual.
Behind this gentleman, one of the most distinguished
and even noble-looking men he
had ever seen, and again some paces to the
right, was a man, evidently a groom, and to
all appearances an orderly in mufti.</p>

<p>The first glance revealed that a duel was
imminent. The duellists, of course, were the
military stranger and the Marquis de Kerival.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" Alan whispered to
Kerbastion. "Do you know?"</p>

<p>"I do not know his name. He is a
soldier&mdash;a general. He came to Kerival to-day;
an hour or more ago. I guided him
through the wood, for he and his man had
ridden into one of the winding alleys and had
lost their way. I heard him ask for the Marquis
de Kerival. I waited about in the
shrubbery of the rose garden to see if ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
if ... some one for whom I waited ...
would come out. After a time, half an hour
or less, this gentleman came forth, ushered
by Raif Kermorvan, the steward. His man
brought around the two horses again. They
mounted, and rode slowly away. I joined
them, and offered to show them a shorter
route than that which they were taking. The
General said they wished to find a glade
known as Merlin's Rest. Then I knew what he
came for, I knew what was going to happen."
"What, Judik?"</p>

<p>"Hush! not so loud. They will hear us!
I knew it was for a duel. It was here that
Andrik de Morvan, the uncle of him whom
you know, was killed by a man&mdash;I forget his
name."</p>

<p>"Why did the man kill Andrik de Morvan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, who knows? Why does one kill any
body? Because he was tired of enduring the
Sieur Andrik longer; he bored him beyond
words to tell, I have heard. Then, too, the
Count, for he was a count, loved Andrik's
wife."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Alan glanced at Judik. For all his rough
wildness, he spoke on occasion like a man of
breeding. Moreover, at no time was he subservient
in his manner. Possibly, Alan thought,
it was true what he had heard: that Judik Kerbastiou
was by moral right Judik de Kerival.</p>

<p>While the onlookers were whispering, the
four men in the glade had all slightly shifted
their position. The Marquis, it was clear,
had insisted upon this. The light had been
in his eyes. Now the antagonists and their
seconds were arranged aright. Kermorvan,
the steward, was speaking slowly: directions
as to the moment when to fire.</p>

<p>Alan knew it would be worse than useless
to interfere. He could but hope that this
was no more than an affair of honor of a
kind not meant to have a fatal issue; a political
quarrel, perhaps; a matter of insignificant
social offence.</p>

<p>Before Raif Kermorvan&mdash;a short, black-haired,
bull-necked man, with a pale face and
protruding light blue eyes&mdash;had finished what
he had to say, Alan noticed what had hitherto
escaped him: that immediately beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
glade, and under a huge sycamore, already in
full leaf, stood the Kerival carriage. Alain,
the coachman, sat on the box, and held the
two black horses in rein. Standing by the
side of the carriage was Georges de Rohan,
the doctor of Kerloek, and a personal friend
of the Marquis Tristran.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kermorvan raised his voice.</p>

<p>"M. le Général, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"I am ready," answered a low, clear voice.</p>

<p>"M. le Marquis, are you ready?"</p>

<p>Tristran de Kerival did not answer, but
assented by a slight nod.</p>

<p>"Then raise your weapons, and fire the
moment I say 'thrice.'"</p>

<p>Both men raised their pistols.</p>

<p>"You have the advantage of me, sir," said
the Marquis coldly, in a voice as audible to
Alan and Judik as to the others. "I present
a good aim to you here. Nevertheless, I warn
you once more that you will not escape me
... this time."</p>

<p>The General smiled; scornfully, Alan
thought. Again, when suddenly he lowered
his pistol and spoke, Alan fancied he detected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
if not a foreign accent, at least a foreign
intonation.</p>

<p>"Once more, Tristran de Kerival, I tell
you that this duel is a crime; a crime against
me, a crime against Mme. la Marquise, a
crime against your daughters, and a crime
against...."</p>

<p>"That will do, General. I am ready. Are
you?"</p>

<p>Without further word the stranger slowly
drew himself together. He raised his arm,
while his opponent did the same.</p>

<p>"<i>Once! Twice! Thrice!</i>" There was a
crack like that of a cattle-whip. Simultaneously
some splinters of wood were blown
from the left side of the wheeled chair.</p>

<p>The Marquis Tristran smiled. He had
reserved his fire. He could aim now with
fatal effect</p>

<p>"It is murder!" muttered Alan, horrified;
but at that moment the Marquis spoke. Alan
leaned forward, intent to hear.</p>

<p>"<i>At last!</i>" That was all. But in the
words was a concentrated longing for revenge,
the utterance of a vivid hate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Tristran de Kerival slowly and with methodical
malignity took aim. There was a flash,
the same whip-like crack.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as though the ball
had missed its mark. Then, suddenly, there
was a bubbling of red froth at the mouth of
the stranger. Still, he stood erect.</p>

<p>Alan looked at the Marquis de Kerival. He
was leaning back, deathly white, but with the
bitter, suppressed smile which every one at the
château knew and hated.</p>

<p>All at once the General swayed, lunged forward,
and fell prone.</p>

<p>Dr. de Rohan ran out from the sycamore,
and knelt beside him. After a few seconds he
looked up.</p>

<p>He did not speak, but every one knew what
his eyes said. To make it unmistakable, he
drew out his handkerchief and put it over the
face of the dead man.</p>

<p>Alan was about to advance when Judik
Kerbastiou plucked him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Hst! M'sieur Alan! There is Mamzelle
Ynys returning! She will be here in another
minute. She must not see what is there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right, Judik. I thank you."</p>

<p>With that he turned and moved swiftly
down the leaf-hid path which would enable
him to intercept Ynys.</p>

<p>"What is it, Alan?" she asked, with wondering
eyes, the moment he was at her side.
"What is it? Why are you so pale?"</p>

<p>"It is because of a duel that has been
fought here. You must go back at once,
dear. There are reasons why you...."</p>

<p>"Is my father one of the combatants? I
know he is out of the château. Tell me
quick! Is he wounded? Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"No, no, darling heart! He is unhurt.
But I can tell you nothing more just now.
Later ... later. But why did you return
here?"</p>

<p>"I came with a message from my mother.
She is in sore trouble, I fear. I found her, on
her couch in the Blue Salon, with tears streaming
down her face and sobs choking her."</p>

<p>"And she wants me ... now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She told me to look for you, and
bring you to her at once."</p>

<p>"Then go straightway back, dear, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
her that I shall be with her immediately.
Yes, go&mdash;go&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>But by the time Ynys had moved into the
alley which led her to the château, and Alan
had returned to the spot where he had left
Judik, rapid changes had occurred.</p>

<p>The wheeled chair had gone. Alan could
see it nearing the South Yews; with the Marquis
Tristran in it, leaning backward and with
head erect. At its side walked Raif Kermorvan.
He seemed to be whispering to the
Seigneur. The carriage had disappeared; with
it Georges de Rohan, the soldier orderly, and,
presumably, the dead man.</p>

<p>Alan stood hesitant, uncertain whether to
go first to the Marquise, or to follow the man
whom he regarded now with an aversion infinitely
deeper than he had ever done hitherto;
with whom, he felt, he never wished to speak
again, for he was a murderer, if ever man was,
and, from Alan's standpoint, a coward as well.
Tristran de Kerival was the deadliest shot in
all the country-side, and he must have known
that, when he challenged his victim, he gave
him his death sentence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not occur to Alan that possibly the
survivor was the man challenged. Instinctively
he knew that this was not so.</p>

<p>Judik suddenly touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Here," he said; "this is the name of the
dead man. I got the servant to write it down
for me."</p>

<p>Alan took the slip of paper. On it was:
"<i>M. le Général Carmichael</i>."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="VIII" id="VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE UNFOLDING OF THE SCROLL</p>


<p>When Alan reached the château he was at
once accosted by old Matieu.</p>

<p>"Mme. la Marquise wishes to see you in
her private room, M'sieu Alan, and without a
moment's delay."</p>

<p>In a few seconds he was on the upper landing.
At the door of the room known as the
Blue Salon he met Yann the Dumb.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ian? Is there any thing
wrong?"</p>

<p>In his haste he spoke in French. The old
islander looked at him, but did not answer.</p>

<p>Alan repeated his question in Gaelic.</p>

<p>"Yes, Alan MacAlasdair, I fear there is
gloom and darkness upon us all."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"By this an' by that. But I have seen the
death-cloth about Lois nic Alasdair bronnach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
for weeks past. I saw it about her feet,
and then about her knees, and then about her
breast. Last night, when I looked at her, I
saw it at her neck. And to-day, the shadow-shroud
is risen to her eyes."</p>

<p>"But your second-sight is not always true,
you know, Ian. Why, you told me when I
was here last that I would soon be seeing
my long dead father again, and, more
than that, that I should see him, but he never
see me. But of this and your other dark
sayings, no more now. Can I go in at once
and see my aunt?"</p>

<p>"I will be asking that, Alan-mo-caraid.
But what you say is not true. I have
never yet 'seen' any thing that has not come
to pass; though I have had the sight but
seldom, to Himself be the praise." With that
Ian entered, exchanged a word or two, and
ushered Alan into the room.</p>

<p>On a couch beside a great fireplace, across
the iron brazier of which were flaming pine-logs,
an elderly woman lay almost supine.
That she had been a woman of great beauty
was unmistakable, for all her gray hair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the ravages that time and suffering had
wrought upon her face. Even now her face
was beautiful; mainly from the expression of
the passionate dusky eyes which were so like
those of Annaik. Her long, inert body
was covered with a fantastic Italian silk-cloth
whose gay pattern emphasized her own helpless
condition. Alan had not seen her for
some months, and he was shocked at the
change. Below the eyes, as flamelike as ever,
were purplish shadows, and everywhere,
through the habitual ivory of the delicate
features, a gray ashiness had diffused. When
she held out her hand to him, he saw it as
transparent as a fan, and perceived within
it the red gleam of the fire.</p>

<p>"Ah, Alan, it is you at last! How glad I
am to see you!" The voice was one of singular
sweetness, in tone and accent much like
that of Ynys.</p>

<p>"Dear Aunt Lois, not more glad than I am
to see you"&mdash;and, as he spoke, Alan kneeled
at the couch and kissed the frail hand that
had been held out to him.</p>

<p>"I would have so eagerly seen you at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
on my arrival," he resumed, "but I was given
your message&mdash;that you had one of your seasons
of suffering, and could not see me. You
have been in pain, Aunt Lois?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I am dying."</p>

<p>"Dying! Oh, no, no, no! You don't
mean <i>that</i>. And besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why should I not mean it? Why should
I fear it, Alan? Has life meant so much
to me of late years that I should wish to
prolong it?"</p>

<p>"But you have endured so long!"</p>

<p>"A bitter reason truly!... and one
too apt to a woman! Well, enough of this.
Alan, I want to speak to you about yourself.
But first tell me one thing. Do you love any
woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with all my heart, with all my life, I
love a woman."</p>

<p>"Have you told her so? Has she betrothed
herself to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it Annaik?"</p>

<p>"Annaik ... Annaik?"</p>

<p>"Why are you so surprised, Alan? Annaik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
is beautiful; she has long loved you, I am
certain; and you, too, if I mistake not, care
for her?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I do; of course I care for her,
Aunt Lois. I love her. But I do not love
her as you mean."</p>

<p>The Marquise looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand," she said
gravely. "I must speak to you about
Annaik, later. But now, will you tell me who
the woman is?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is Ynys."</p>

<p>"<i>Ynys!</i> But, Alan, do you not know that
she is betrothed to Andrik de Morvan?"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"And that such a betrothal is, in Brittany,
almost as binding as a marriage?"</p>

<p>"I have heard that said."</p>

<p>"And that the Marquis de Kerival wishes
that union to take place?"</p>

<p>"The Marquis Tristran's opinion, on any
matter, does not in any way concern me."</p>

<p>"That may be, Alan; but it concerns Ynys.
Do you know that I also wish her to marry
Andrik; that his parents wish it; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
every one regards the union as all but an
accomplished fact?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear Aunt Lois, I have known or
presumed all you tell me. But nothing of it
can alter what is a vital part of my existence."</p>

<p>"Do you know that Ynys herself gave her
pledge to Andrik de Morvan?"</p>

<p>"It was a conditional pledge. But, in any
case, she will formally renounce it."</p>

<p>For a time there was silence.</p>

<p>Alan had risen, and now stood by the side
of the couch, with folded arms. The Marquise
Lois looked up at him, with her steadfast,
shadowy eyes. When she spoke again
she averted them, and her voice was so low as
almost to be a whisper.</p>

<p>"Finally, Alan, let me ask you one question.
It is not about you and Ynys. I infer
that both of you are at one in your determination
to take every thing into your own hands.
Presumably you can maintain her and yourself.
Tristran&mdash;the Marquis de Kerival&mdash;will
not contribute a franc toward her support.
If he knew, he would turn her out of doors
this very day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Lois, I wait for your final
question?"</p>

<p>"It is this. <i>What about Annaik?</i>"</p>

<p>Startled by her tone and sudden lifted
glance, Alan stared in silence; then recollecting
himself, he repeated dully:</p>

<p>"'What about Annaik?' ... Annaik, Aunt
Lois, why do you ask me about Annaik?"</p>

<p>"She loves you."</p>

<p>"As a brother; as the betrothed of Ynys;
as a dear comrade and friend."</p>

<p>"Do not be a hypocrite, Alan. You know
that she loves you. What of your feeling
toward <i>her</i>?"</p>

<p>"I love her ... as a brother loves a sister
... as any old playmate and friend ...
as ... as the sister of Ynys."</p>

<p>A faint, scornful smile came upon the white
lips of the Marquise.</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough, then, to
explain about last night?"</p>

<p>"About last night?"</p>

<p>"Come, be done with evasion. Yes, about
last night. Alan, I know that you and
Annaik were out together in the cypress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
avenue, and again, on the dunes, after midnight;
that you were seen walking hand in
hand; and that, stealthily, you entered the
house together."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well! The inference is obvious. But
I will let you see that I know more. Annaik
went out of the house late. Old Matieu let
her out. Shortly after that you went out of
the château. Later, you and she came upon
Judik Kerbastiou prowling about in the
woods. It was more than an hour after he
left you that you returned to the château.
Where were you during that hour or more?"</p>

<p>Alan flushed. He unfolded his arms;
hesitated; then refolded them.</p>

<p>"How do you know this?" he asked
simply.</p>

<p>"I know it, because...."</p>

<p>But before she finished what she was about
to say, the door opened and Yann entered.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ian?"</p>

<p>"I would be speaking to you alone for
a minute, Bantighearna."</p>

<p>"Alan, go to the alcove yonder, please.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
I must hear in private what Yann has to say
to me."</p>

<p>As soon as the young man was out of hearing,
Yann stooped and spoke in low tones.
The Marquise Lois grew whiter and whiter,
till not a vestige of color remained in her
face, and the only sign of life was in the eyes.
Suddenly she made an exclamation.</p>

<p>Alan turned and looked at her. He caught
her agonized whisper: "<i>Oh, my God!</i>"</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;oh, what is it, dear Aunt
Lois?" he cried, as he advanced to her side.</p>

<p>He expected to be waved back, but to
his surprise the Marquise made no sign to
him to withdraw. Instead, she whispered
some instructions to Yann and then bade
him go.</p>

<p>When they were alone once more, she took
a small silver flagon from beneath her coverlet
and poured a few drops upon some
sugar.</p>

<p>Having taken this, she seemed to breathe
more easily. It was evident, at the same
time, that she had received some terrible
shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alan, come closer. I cannot speak loud.
I have no time to say more to you about
Annaik. I must leave that to you and to
her. But lest I die, let me say at once that
I forbid you to marry Ynys, and that I enjoin
you to marry Annaik, and that without
delay."</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed the speaker's face.
She stopped, and gasped for breath. When
at last she resumed, it was clear she considered
as settled the matter on which she
had spoken.</p>

<p>"Alan, I am so unwell that I must be very
brief. And now listen. You are twenty-five
to-day. Such small fortune as is yours comes
now into your possession. It has been administered
for you by a firm of lawyers in
Edinburgh. See, here is the address. Can
you read it? Yes?... Well, keep the slip.
This fortune is not much. To many, possibly
to you, it may not seem enough to provide
more than the bare necessities of life, not
enough for its needs. Nevertheless, it is
your own, and you will be glad. It will, at
least, suffice to keep you free from need if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
ever you fulfil your great wish to go back to
the land of your fathers, to your own place."</p>

<p>"That is still my wish and my hope."</p>

<p>"So be it! You will have also an old sea
castle, not much more than a keep, on a
remote island. It will at any rate be your
own. It is on an island where few people
are; a wild and precipitous isle far out in
the Atlantic at the extreme of the Southern
Hebrides."</p>

<p>"Is it called Rona?" Alan interrupted
eagerly.</p>

<p>Without noticing, or heeding, his eagerness,
she assented.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is called Rona. Near it are the
isles of Mingulay and Borosay. These three
islands were once populous, and it was there
that for hundreds of years your father's clan,
of which he was hereditary chief, lived and
prospered. After the evil days, the days
when the young King was hunted in the west
as though a royal head were the world's
desire, and when our brave kinswoman,
Flora Macdonald, proved that women as well
as men could dare all for a good cause&mdash;after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
those evil days the people melted away.
Soon the last remaining handful were upon
Borosay; and there, too, till the great fire
that swept the island a score of years ago,
stood the castle of my ancestors, the Macdonalds
of Borosay.</p>

<p>"My father was a man well known in his
day. The name of Sir Kenneth Macdonald
was as familiar in London as in Edinburgh;
and in Paris he was known to all the military
and diplomatic world, for in his youth he had
served in the French army with distinction,
and held the honorary rank of general.</p>

<p>"Not long before my mother's death he came
back to our lonely home in Borosay, bringing
with him a kinsman of another surname, who
owned the old castle of Rona on the Isle of
the Sea-caves, as Rona is often called by the
people of the Hebrides. Also there came with
him a young French officer of high rank. After
a time I was asked to marry this man. I did
not love him, did not even care for him, and
I refused. In truth ... already, though unknowingly,
I loved your father&mdash;he that was
our kinsman and owned Rona and its old castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
But Alasdair did not speak; and, because of
that, we each came to sorrow.</p>

<p>"My father told me he was ruined. If I did
not marry Tristran de Kerival, he would lose
all. Moreover, my dying mother begged me
to save the man she had loved so well and
truly, though he had left her so much alone.</p>

<p>"Well, to be brief, I agreed. My kinsman
Alasdair was away at the time. He returned
on the eve of the very day on which I was
suddenly married by Father Somerled Macdonald.
We were to remain a few weeks in
Borosay because of my mother's health.</p>

<p>"When Alasdair learned what had happened
he was furious. I believe he even drew a riding
whip across the face of Tristran de Kerival.
Fierce words passed between them, and
a cruel taunt that rankled. Nor would Alasdair
have any word with me at all. He sent
me a bitter message, but the bitterest word
he could send was that which came to me:
that he and my sister Silis had gone away
together.</p>

<p>"From that day I never saw Silis again, till
the time of her death. Soon afterward our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
mother died, and while the island-funeral was
being arranged our father had a stroke, and
himself died, in time to be buried along with
his wife. It was only then that I realized
how more than true had been his statements
as to his ruin. He died penniless. I was
reminded of this unpleasant fact at the time,
by the Marquis de Kerival; and I have had
ample opportunity since for bearing it in
vivid remembrance.</p>

<p>"As soon as possible we settled all that
could be settled, and left for Brittany. I
have sometimes thought my husband's love
was killed when he discovered that Alasdair
had loved me. He forbade me even to mention
his name, unless he introduced it; and
he was wont to swear that a day would
come when he would repay in full what he
believed to be the damning insult he had
received.</p>

<p>"We took with us only one person from
Borosay, an islander of Rona. He is, in fact,
a clansman both of you and me. It is of Ian
I speak, of course; him that soon came to be
called here Yann the Dumb. My husband and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
I had at least this to unite us: that we were
both Celtic, and had all our racial sympathies
in common.</p>

<p>"I heard from Silis that she was married
and was happy. I am afraid this did not add
to my happiness. She wrote to me, too, when
she was about to bear her child. Strangely
enough, Alasdair, who, like his father before
him, was an officer in the French army, was
then stationed not far from Kerival, though
my husband knew nothing of this at first.
My own boy and Silis's were born about the
same time. My child died; that of Silis and
Alasdair lived. You are that child. No ...
wait, Alan ... I will tell you his name shortly....
You, I say, are that child. Soon afterward,
Silis had a dangerous relapse. In her
delirium she said some wild things; among
them, words to the effect that the child which
had died was hers, and that the survivor was
mine&mdash;that, somehow or other, they had been
changed. Then, too, she cried out in her
waywardness&mdash;and, poor girl, she must have
known then that Alasdair had loved me before
he loved her&mdash;that the child who lived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
he who had been christened Alan, was the
child of Alasdair and myself.</p>

<p>"All this poor delirium at the gate of death
meant nothing. But in some way it came to
Tristran's ears, and he believed. After Silis's
death I had brought you home, Alan, and had
announced that I would adopt you. I promised
Silis this, in her last hour, when she was
in her right mind again; also that the child,
you, should be brought up to speak and think
in our own ancient language, and that in all
ways you should grow up a true Gael. I have
done my best, Alan?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, indeed you have. I shall never,
never forget that you have been my mother
to me."</p>

<p>"Well, my husband never forgave that.
He acquiesced, but he never forgave. For
long, and I fear to this day, he persists in his
belief that you are really my illegitimate child,
and that Silis was right in thinking that I had
succeeded in having my own new-born babe
transferred to her arms, while her dead offspring
was brought to me, and, as my own,
interred. It has created a bitter feud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
and that is why he hates the sight of you.
That, too, Alan, is why he would never
consent to your marriage with either Ynys
or Annaik."</p>

<p>"But you yourself urged me a little ago to
... to ... marry Annaik."</p>

<p>"I had a special reason. Besides, I of
course know the truth. In his heart, God
knows, my husband cannot doubt it."</p>

<p>"Then tell me this: is my father dead also,
as I have long surmised?"</p>

<p>"No ... yes, yes, Alan, he is dead."</p>

<p>Alan noticed his aunt's confusion, and regarded
her steadily.</p>

<p>"Why do you first say 'no' and then
'yes'?"</p>

<p>"Because...."</p>

<p>But here again an interruption occurred.
The portière moved back, and then the wide
doors disparted. Into the salon was wheeled
a chair, in which sat the Marquis de Kerival.
Behind him was his attendant; at
his side, Kermorvan the steward. The face
of the seigneur was still deathly pale, and the
features were curiously drawn. The silky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
hair, too, seemed whiter than ever, and white
as foam-drift on a dark wave were the long
thin hands which lay on the lap of the black
velvet shooting jacket he wore.</p>

<p>"Ah, Lois, is this a prepared scene?" he
exclaimed in a cold and sneering voice, "or,
has the young man known all along?"</p>

<p>"Tristan, I have not yet told him what I
now know. Be merciful."</p>

<p>"Alan MacAlasdair, as the Marquise here
calls you,&mdash;and she ought to know,&mdash;have
you learned yet the name and rank of your
father?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Tell him, Lois."</p>

<p>"Tristran, listen. All is over now. Soon
I, too, shall be gone. In the name of God I
pray you to relent from this long cruelty, this
remorseless infamy. You know as well as I
do that our first-born is dead twenty-five
years ago, and that this man here is truly the
son of Silis, my sister. And here is one overwhelming
proof for you: <i>I have just been
urging him to marry Annaik.</i>"</p>

<p>At that Tristran the Silent was no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
silent. With a fierce laugh he turned to the
steward.</p>

<p>"I call you to witness, Raif Kermorvan,
that I would kill Annaik, or Ynys either for
that matter, before I would allow such an
unnatural union. Once and for all I absolutely
ban it. Besides.... Listen, you there
with your father's eyes! You are sufficiently
a Gael to feel that you would not marry the
daughter of a man who killed your father?"</p>

<p>"God forbid!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, God does forbid. Lois, tell
this man what you know."</p>

<p>"Alan," began the Marquise quaveringly,
her voice fluttering like a dying bird, "the
name of your father is ... is ... Alasdair
... Alasdair Carmichael!"</p>

<p>"<i>Carmichael!</i>"</p>

<p>For a moment he was dazed, bewildered.
When, recently, had he heard that name?</p>

<p>Then it flashed upon him. He turned with
flaming eyes to where the Marquis sat, quietly
watching him.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" That was all. He could
say no more. His heart was in his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, hoarse and trembling, he put out his
hands.</p>

<p>"Tell me it is not true! Tell me it is not
true!"</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> is not true, Alan Carmichael?"</p>

<p>"That that was he who died in the wood
yonder."</p>

<p>"That was General Alasdair Carmichael."</p>

<p>"My father?"</p>

<p>"Your father!"</p>

<p>"But, you devil, you murdered him! I
saw you do it! You knew it was he&mdash;and
you killed him. You knew he would not try
to kill you, and you waited; then, when he
had fired, you took careful aim and killed
him!"</p>

<p>"You reiterate, my friend. These are
facts with which I am familiar."</p>

<p>The cool, sneering tone stung Alan to madness.
He advanced menacingly.</p>

<p>"Murderer, you shall not escape!"</p>

<p>"A fitting sentiment, truly, from a man
who wants to marry my daughter!"</p>

<p>"Marry your daughter! Marry the daughter
of my father's murderer! I would sooner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
never see the face of woman again than do
this thing."</p>

<p>"Good! I am well content. And now,
young man, you are of age; you have come into
your patrimony, including your ruined keep
on the island of Rona; and I will trouble
you to go&mdash;to leave Kerival for good and all."</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a word, Alan moved
rapidly forward. With a light touch he laid
his hand for a moment on the brow of the
motionless man in the wheeled chair.</p>

<p>"There! I lay upon you, Tristran de Kerival,
the curse of the newly dead and of the
living! May the evil that you have done
corrode your brain, and may your life silt
away as sand, and may your soul know the
second death!"</p>

<p>As he turned to leave the room he saw
Kerbastiou standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Who are you, to be standing there, Judik
Kerbastiou?" demanded the steward angrily.</p>

<p>"I am Rohan de Kerival. Ask this man
here if I am not his son. Three days ago the
woman who was my mother died. She died a
vagrant, in the forest. But, nigh upon thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
years ago, she was legally married to the
young Marquis Tristran de Kerival. I am
their child."</p>

<p>Alan glanced at the man he had cursed. A
strange look had come into his ashy face.</p>

<p>"Her name?" was all Tristran the Silent
said.</p>

<p>"Annora Brizeux."</p>

<p>"You have proofs?"</p>

<p>"I have all the proofs."</p>

<p>"You are only a peasant, I disown you. I
know nothing of you or of the wanton that
was your mother."</p>

<p>Without a word Judik strode forward and
struck him full in the face. At that moment
the miraculous happened. The Marquise,
who had not stood erect for years, rose to her
full height.</p>

<p>She, too, crossed the room.</p>

<p>"Alan," she cried, "see! He has killed
me as well as your father," and with that she
swayed, and fell dead, at the feet of the man
who had trampled her soul in the dust and
made of her blossoming life a drear and sterile
wilderness.</p>

<h3><a name="IX" id="IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h3>

<p class="center">RETROSPECTIVE: FROM THE HEBRID ISLES</p>


<p>At the end of the third month after that
disastrous day when Alan Carmichael knew
that his father had been slain, and before his
unknowing eyes, by Tristran de Kerival, a
great terror came upon him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On that day itself he had left the Manor of
Kerival. With all that blood between him
and his enemy he could not stay a moment
longer in the house. To have done so would
have been to show himself callous indeed to
the memory of his father.</p>

<p>Nor could he see Ynys. He could not look
at her, innocent as she was. She was her
father's child, and her father had murdered
his father. Surely a union would be against
nature; he must fly while he had the strength.</p>

<p>When, however, he had gained the yew close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
he turned, hesitated, and then slowly walked
northward to where the long brown dunes lay
in a golden glow over against the pale blue of
the sea. There, bewildered, wrought almost
to madness, he moved to and fro, unable to
realize all that had happened, and with bitter
words cursing the malign fate which had overtaken
him.</p>

<p>The afternoon waned, and he was still there,
uncertain as ever, still confused, baffled,
mentally blind.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he saw the figure of Yann the
Dumb, his friend and clansman, Ian Macdonald.
The old man seemed to understand at
once that, after what had happened, Alan
Carmichael would never go back to Kerival.</p>

<p>"Why do you come to see me here, Ian?"
Alan had asked wearily.</p>

<p>When Ian began, "<i>Thiginn gu d'choimhead</i>
... I would come to see you, though your
home were a rock-cave," the familiar sound
of the Gaelic did more than any thing else to
clear his mind of the shadows which overlay it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Alan MacAlasdair," Ian answered, in
response to an eager question, "whatever I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
know is yours now, since Lois nic Choinneach
is dead, poor lady; though, sure, it is the best
thing she could be having now, that death."</p>

<p>As swiftly as possible Alan elicited all he
could from the old man; all that there had not
been time to hear from the Marquise. He
learned what a distinguished soldier, what a
fine man, what a true Gael, Alasdair Carmichael
had been. When his wife had died he
had been involved in some disastrous lawsuit,
and his deep sorrow and absolute financial ruin
came to him at one and the same moment. It
was at this juncture, though there were other
good reasons also, that Lois de Kerival had
undertaken to adopt and bring up Silis's child.
When her husband Tristran had given his consent,
it was with the stipulation that Lois and
Alasdair Carmichael should never meet, and
that the child was not to learn his surname
till he came into the small fortune due to him
through his mother.</p>

<p>This and much else Alan learned from Ian.
Out of all the pain grew a feeling of bitter
hatred for the cold, hard man who had wrought
so much unhappiness, and were it not for Ynys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and Annaik he would, for the moment, have
rejoiced that, in Judik Kerbastiou, Nemesis had
appeared. At his first mention of the daughters,
Ian had looked at him closely.</p>

<p>"Will you be for going back to that house,
Alan MacAlasdair?" he asked, and in a tone
so marked that, even in his distress, Alan
noticed it.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to go back, Ian?"</p>

<p>"God forbid! I hear the dust on the threshold
rising at the thought."</p>

<p>"We are both in an alien land, Ian."</p>

<p>"<i>Och is diombuan gach cas air tìr gun eòlas</i>&mdash;Fleeting
is the foot in a strange land," said
the islander, using a phrase familiar to Gaels
away from the isles.</p>

<p>"But what can I do?"</p>

<p>"Sure you can go to your own place, Alan
MacAlasdair. There you can think of what
you will do. And before you go I must tell
you that your father's brother Uilleam is dead,
so that you have no near kin now except the
son of the brother of your father, Donnacha
Bàn as he is called&mdash;or was called, for I
will be hearing a year or more ago that he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
too, went under the wave. He would be your
own age, and that close as a month or week, I
am thinking."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Ian, I cannot go without
seeing my cousin Ynys once more."</p>

<p>"You will never be for marrying the daughter
of the man that murdered your father?"
Ian spoke in horrified amaze, adding, "Sure,
if that were so, it would indeed mean that they
may talk as they like of this southland as akin
to Gaeldom, though that is not a thought that
will bring honey to the hive of my brain;&mdash;for
no man of the isles would ever forget <i>there</i>
that the blood of a father cries up to the stars
themselves."</p>

<p>"Have you no message for me, from ...
from ... her?"</p>

<p>"Ay," answered the old islesman reluctantly.
"Here it is. I did not give it to you
before, for fear you should be weak."</p>

<p>Without a word, Alan snatched the pencilled
note. It had no beginning or signature, and
ran simply: "My mother is dead, too. After
all that has happened to-day I know we cannot
meet. I know, too, that I love you with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
my heart and soul; that I have given you
my deathless devotion. But, unless you say
'Come,' it is best that you go away at once,
and that we never see each other again."</p>

<p>At that, Alan had torn off the half sheet,
and written a single word upon it.</p>

<p>It was "<i>Come.</i>"</p>

<p>This he gave to Ian, telling him to go
straightway with it, and hand the note to
Ynys in person. "Also," he added, "fulfil
unquestioningly every thing she may tell you
to do or not to do."</p>

<p>An hour or more after Ian had gone, and
when a dark, still gloaming had begun, he
came again, but this time with Ynys. He and
she walked together; behind them came four
horses, led by Ian. When the lovers met,
they had stood silent for some moments.
Then Ynys, knowing what was in Alan's mind,
asked if she were come for life or death.</p>

<p>"I love you, dear," was his answer; "I
cannot live without you. If you be in truth
the daughter of the man who slew my father,
why should his evil blood be our undoing also?
God knows but that even thus may his punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
be begun. All his thoughts were upon
you and Annaik."</p>

<p>"Annaik is gone."</p>

<p>"Gone! Annaik gone! Where has she
gone?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing. She sent me a line to
say that she would never sleep in Kerival
again; that something had changed her whole
life; that she would return three days hence
for our mother's funeral; and that thereafter
she and I would never meet."</p>

<p>In a flash Alan saw many things; but
deepest of all he saw the working of doom.
On the very day of his triumph Tristran de
Kerival had lost all, and found only that
which made life more bitter than death.
Stammeringly now, Alan sought to say something
about Annaik; that there was a secret, an
unhappiness, a sorrow, which he must explain.</p>

<p>But at that Ynys had pointed to the dim
gray-brown sea.</p>

<p>"There, Alan, let us bury it all there; every
thing, every thing! Either you and I must
find our forgetfulness there, or we must
drown therein all this terrible past which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
an inexplicable, a menacing present. Dear, I
am ready. Shall it be life or death?"</p>

<p>"Life."</p>

<p>That was all that was said. Alan leaned
forward, and tenderly kissing her, took her in
his arms. Then he turned to Ian.</p>

<p>"Ian mac Iain, I call you to witness that I
take Ynys de Kerival as my wife; that in this
taking all the blood-feud that lies betwixt us
is become as nought; and that the past is
past. Henceforth I am Alan Carmichael, and
she here is Ynys Carmichael."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At that, Ian had bowed his head. It was
against the tradition of his people; but he
loved Ynys as well as Alan, and secretly he
was glad.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Alan and Ynys had mounted,
and ridden slowly southward through the
dusk; while Ian followed on the third horse,
with, in rein, its companion, on which were
the apparel and other belongings which Ynys
had hurriedly put together.</p>

<p>They were unmolested in their flight.
Indeed, they met no one, till, at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the Forest of Kerival, they emerged near
the junction with the high-road at a place
called Trois Chênes. Then a woman, a
gypsy vagrant, insisted disaster would ensue
if they went over her tracks that night without
first doing something to avert evil. They
must cross her hand with silver, she said.</p>

<p>Impatient as he was, Alan stopped, and
allowed the gypsy to have her will.</p>

<p>She looked at the hand Ynys held out
through the obscurity, and almost immediately
dropped it.</p>

<p>"Beware of crossing the sea," she said. "I
see your death floating on a green wave."</p>

<p>Ynys shuddered, but said nothing. When
Alan put out his hand the woman held it in
hers for a few seconds, and then pondered it
intently.</p>

<p>"Be quick, my good woman," he urged,
"we are in a hurry."</p>

<p>"It will be behind the shadow when we
meet again," was all her reply: enigmatical
words, which yet in his ears had a sombre
significance. But he was even more
perturbed by the fact that, before she relinquished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
his hand, she stooped abruptly and
kissed it.</p>

<p>As the fugitives rode onward along the dusky
high-road, Alan whispered to Ynys that he could
not forget the gypsy; that in some strange
way she haunted him; and even seemed to
him to be linked to that disastrous day.</p>

<p>"That may well be," Ynys had answered,
"for the woman was Annaik."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Onward they rode till they came to Haut-Kerloek,
the ancient village on the slope of
the hill above the little town. There, at the
Gloire de Kerival they stopped for the night.
Next morning they resumed their journey,
and the same afternoon reached St. Blaise-sur-Loise,
where they knew they would find
the body of General Alasdair Carmichael.</p>

<p>And it was thus that, by the strange irony of
fate, Alasdair Carmichael, who had never seen
his son, who in turn had unknowingly witnessed
his father's tragic death, was followed
to the grave-side by that dear child for whom
he had so often longed, and that by Alan's
side was the daughter of the man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
done so much to ruin his life and had at the
last slain him. At the same hour, on the
same day, Lois de Kerival was laid to her
rest, with none of her kith and kin to lament
her; for Tristran the Silent was alone in his
austere grief. Two others were there, at
whom the Curé looked askance: the rude
woodlander, Judik Kerbastiou, and another
forest estray, a gypsy woman with a shawl
over her head. The latter must have known
the Marquise's charity, for the good woman
wept quietly throughout the service of committal,
and, when she turned to go, the Curé
heard a sob in her throat.</p>

<p>It took but a brief while for Alan to settle
his father's few affairs. Among the papers
he found one addressed to himself: a long
letter wherein was set forth not only all
necessary details concerning Alan's mother
and father, but also particulars about the
small fortune that was in keeping for him in
Edinburgh, and the lonely house on the lonely
Isle of Rona among the lonely Hebrides.</p>

<p>In St. Blaise Alan and Ynys went before
the civil authorities, and were registered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
man and wife. The next day they resumed
their journey toward that exile which they
had in view.</p>

<p>Thereafter, slowly, and by devious ways,
they fared far north. At Edinburgh Alan had
learned all that was still unexplained. He
found that there would be enough money to
enable Ynys and himself to live quietly, particularly
at so remote a place as Rona. The
castle or "keep" there was unoccupied, and
had, indeed, long been untenanted save by the
widow-woman Kirsten Macdonald, Ian's sister.
In return for this home, she had kept the
solitary place in order. All the furniture that
had been there, when Alasdair Carmichael
was last in Rona, remained. In going
thither, Alan and Ynys would be going home.</p>

<p>The westward journey was a revelation
to them. Never had there been so beautiful
a May, they were told. They had
lingered long at the first place where
they heard the sweet familiar sound of
the Gaelic. Hand in hand, they wandered
over the hill-sides of which the very
names had a poignant home-sweetness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and long, hot hours they spent together on
lochs of which Lois de Kerival had often
spoken with deep longing in her voice.</p>

<p>As they neared the extreme of the mainland,
Alan's excitement deepened. He spoke
hardly a word on the day the steamer left the
Argyle coast behind, and headed for the dim
isles of the sea, Coll and Tiree; and again on
the following day Ynys saw how distraught
he was, for, about noon, the coast-line of
Uist loomed, faintly blue, upon the dark
Atlantic horizon.</p>

<p>At Loch Boisdale, where they disembarked,
and whence they had to sail the remainder of
their journey in a fishing schooner, which by
good fortune was then there and disengaged,
Ian was for the first time recognized. All
that evening Alan and Ynys talked with the
islesmen; Alan finding, to his delight, his
Gaelic was so good that none for a moment
suspected he had not lived in the isles all his
life. That of Ynys, however, though fluent,
had a foreign sound in it which puzzled the
admiring fishermen.</p>

<p>It was an hour after sunrise when the <i>Blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Herring</i> sailed out of Loch Boisdale, and it
was an hour before sunset when the anchor
dropped in Borosay Haven.</p>

<p>On this night Alan perceived the first sign
of aloofness among his fellow Gaels. Hitherto
every one had been cordial, and he and Ynys
had rejoiced in the courtesy and genial friendliness
which they had everywhere encountered.</p>

<p>But in Balnaree ("Baille'-na-Righ"), the little
village wherein was focussed all that Borosay
had to boast of in the way of civic life, he
could not disguise from himself that again and
again he was looked at askance.</p>

<p>Rightly or wrongly he took this to be resentment
because of his having wed Ynys, the
daughter of the man who had murdered Alasdair
Carmichael. So possessed was he by this
idea that he did not remember how little likely
the islanders were to know aught concerning
Ynys, or indeed any thing beyond the fact
that Alasdair MacAlasdair Rhona had died
abroad.</p>

<p>The trouble became more than an imaginary
one when, on the morrow, he tried to find a
boat for the passage to Rona. But for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Frozen Hand, as the triple-peaked hill to the
south of Balnaree was called, Rona would
have been visible; nor was it, with a fair wind,
more than an hour's sail distant.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, every one to whom he spoke
showed a strange reluctance. At last, in despair,
he asked an old man of his own surname
why there was so much difficulty.</p>

<p>In the island way, Sheumas Carmichael replied
that the people on Elleray, the island
adjacent to Rona, were incensed.</p>

<p>"But incensed at what?"</p>

<p>"Well, at this and at that. But for one
thing they are not having any dealings with
the Carmichaels. They are all Macdonalds,
there, Macdonalds of Barra. There is a feud,
I am thinking; though I know nothing of it;
no, not I."</p>

<p>"But Seumas mac Eachainn, you know well
yourself that there are almost no Carmichaels
to have a feud with! There are you and your
brother, and there is your cousin over at
Sgòrr-Bhan on the other side of Borosay.
Who else is there?"</p>

<p>To this the man could say nothing. Distressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Alan sought Ian and bade him find
out what he could. He, also, however, was
puzzled and even seriously perturbed. That
some evil was at work could not be doubted;
and that it was secret boded ill.</p>

<p>Ian was practically a stranger in Borosay
because of his long absence. But though this,
for a time, shut him off from his fellow islanders,
and retarded his discovery of what
strange reason accounted for the apparently
inexplicable apathy shown by the fishermen of
Balnaree,&mdash;an apathy, too, so much to their
own disadvantage,&mdash;it enabled him, on the
other hand, to make a strong appeal to the
clan-side of the islanders' natures. After all,
Ian mac Iain mhic Dhonuill was one of them,
and though he came there with a man in a
shadow (though this phrase was not used in
Ian's hearing), that was not his fault.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ian remembered a fact that he
should have thought of at once. There was
the old woman, his sister Kirsten. He would
speak of her, and of their long separation,
and of his desire to see her again before he
died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>This made a difficult thing easy. Within an
hour a boat was ready to take the travellers
to the Isle of the Caves&mdash;as Rona was called
locally. Before the hour was gone, they, with
the stores of food and other things they had
been advised to take with them, were slipping
seaward out of Borosay Haven.</p>

<p>The moment the headland was rounded the
heights of Rona came into view. Great gaunt
cliffs they are, precipices of black basalt;
though on the south side they fall away in
grassy declivities which hang a greenness over
the wandering wave forever sobbing round
that desolate shore. But it was not till the
Sgòrr-Dhu, a conical black rock at the southeast
end of the island, was reached that the
stone keep, known as Caisteal-Rhona, came in
sight.</p>

<p>It stands at the landward extreme of a
rocky ledge, on the margin of a green <i>airidh</i>.
Westward is a small dark-blue sea loch, no
more than a narrow haven. To the northwest
rise sheer the ocean-fronting precipitous
cliffs; northward, above the green pasture
and a stretch of heather, is a woodland-belt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
some three or four hundred pine-trees. It
might well be called I-monair, as Aodh the
Islander sang of it; for it is ever echoing with
murmurous noises. If the waves dash against
it from the south or east, a loud crying is
upon the faces of the rocks; if from the north
or north-east, there is a dull iteration, and
amid the pines a continual soughing sea voice.
But when the wind blows from the south-west,
or the huge Atlantic billows surge out of the
west, Rona is a place filled with an indescribable
tumult. Through the whole island goes
the myriad echo of a hollow booming, with an
incessant sound as though waters were pouring
through vast hidden conduits in the heart of
every precipice, every rock, every bowlder.
This is because of the arcades of which it
consists, for from the westward the island has
been honeycombed by the sea. No living man
has ever traversed all those mysterious, winding
sea galleries. Many have perished in the
attempt. In the olden days the Uisteans and
Barrovians sought refuge there from the marauding
Danes and other pirates out of Lochlin;
and in the time when the last Scottish king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
took shelter in the west many of his island
followers found safety among these perilous
arcades.</p>

<p>Some of them reach to an immense height.
These are filled with a pale green gloom which
in fine weather, and at noon or toward sundown,
becomes almost radiant. But most
have only a dusky green obscurity, and some
are at all times dark with a darkness that has
seen neither sun nor moon nor star for unknown
ages. Sometimes, there, a phosphorescent
wave will spill a livid or a cold blue flame,
and for a moment a vast gulf of dripping
basalt be revealed; but day and night, night
and day, from year to year, from age to age,
that awful wave-clamant darkness prevails
unbroken.</p>

<p>To the few who know some of the secrets of
the Passages, it is possible, except when a gale
blows from any quarter but the north, to thrid
these dim arcades in a narrow boat, and so to
pass from the Hebrid Seas to the outer Atlantic.
But to one unaware of the clews there
might well be no return to the light of the
open day; for in that maze of winding galleries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and dim, sea-washed, and forever unlitten
arcades, there is only a hopeless bewilderment.
Once bewildered, there is no hope;
and the lost adventurer will remain there idly
drifting from barren corridor to corridor, till
he perish of hunger and thirst, or, maddened
by the strange and appalling gloom and the
unbroken silence,&mdash;for there the muffled voice
of the sea is no more than a whisper,&mdash;he leap
into the green waters which forever slide
stealthily from ledge to ledge.</p>

<p>From Ian mac Iain Alan had heard of such
an isle, though he had not known it to be
Rona. Now, as he approached his wild, remote
home he thought of these death-haunted
corridors, avenues of the grave as they are
called in the "Cumha Fhir-Mearanach Aonghas
mhic Dhonuill&mdash;the Lament of mad
Angus Macdonald."</p>

<p>When, at last, the unwieldy brown coble
sailed into the little haven it was to create
unwonted excitement among the few fishermen
who put in there frequently for bait. A
group of eight or ten was upon the rocky
ledge beyond Caisteal-Rhona, among them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
elderly woman who was sister to Ian mac
Iain.</p>

<p>At Alan's request, Ian went ashore in advance,
in a small punt. He was to wave his
hand if all were well, for Alan could not but
feel apprehensive on account of the strange
ill-will that had shown itself at Borosay.</p>

<p>It was with relief that he saw the signal
when, after Ian had embraced his sister, and
shaken hands with all the fishermen, he had
explained that the son of Alasdair Carmichael
was come out of the south, and with a beautiful
young wife, too, and was henceforth to
live at Caisteal-Rhona.</p>

<p>All there uncovered and waved their hats.
Then a shout of welcome went up, and Alan's
heart was glad, and that of Ynys. But the
moment he had set foot on land he saw a
startled look come into the eyes of the fishermen&mdash;a
look that deepened swiftly into one of
aversion, almost of fear.</p>

<p>One by one the men moved away, awkward
in their embarrassment. Not one came
forward with outstretched hand, nor said a
word of welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>At first amazed, then indignant, Ian reproached
them. They received his words in
ashamed silence. Even when with a bitter
tongue he taunted them, they answered nothing.</p>

<p>"Giorsal," said Ian, turning in despair to
his sister, "what is the meaning of this folly?"</p>

<p>But even she was no longer the same. Her
eyes were fixed upon Alan with a look of
dread and indeed of horror. It was unmistakable,
and Alan himself was conscious of it,
with a strange sinking of the heart. "Speak,
woman!" he demanded. "What is the meaning
of this thing? Why do you and these
men look at me askance?"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" answered Giorsal Macdonald
with white lips; "God forbid that
we look at the son of Alasdair Carmichael
askance. But...."</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>With that the woman put her apron over
her head and moved away, muttering strange
words.</p>

<p>"Ian, what is this mystery?"</p>

<p>It was Ynys who spoke now, for on Alan's
face was a shadow, and in his eyes a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
gloom. She, too, was white, and had fear in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"How am I for knowing, Ynys-nighean-Lhois?
It is all a darkness to me also. But
I will find out."</p>

<p>That, however, was easier for Ian to say than
to do. Meanwhile, the brown cobble tacked
back to Borosay, and the fishermen sailed away
to the Barra coasts, and Alan and Ynys were
left solitary in their wild and remote home.</p>

<p>But in that very solitude they found healing.
From what Giorsal hinted, they came to believe
that the fishermen had experienced one
of those strange dream-waves which, in
remote isles, occur at times, when whole
communities will be wrought by the selfsame
fantasy. When day by day went past,
and no one came nigh them, at first they
were puzzled and even resentful, but this
passed and soon they were glad to be alone.
Only, Ian knew that there was another cause
for the inexplicable aversion that had been
shown. But he was silent, and he kept a
patient watch for the hour that the future
held in its dim shroud. As for Giorsal, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
was dumb; but no more looked at Alan
askance.</p>

<p>And so the weeks went. Occasionally, a
fishing smack came with the provisions for
the weekly despatch of which Alan had
arranged at Loch Boisdale, and sometimes
the Barra men put in at the haven, though
they would never stay long, and always
avoided Alan as much as was possible.</p>

<p>In that time Alan and Ynys came to know
and love their strangely beautiful island home.
Hours and hours at a time they spent exploring
the dim, green winding sea galleries, till at
last they knew the main corridors thoroughly.
They had even ventured into some of the
narrow snake-like passages, but never for
long, because of the awe and dread these held,
silent estuaries of the grave.</p>

<p>There, too, they forgot all the sorrow that
had been theirs, forgot the shadow of death
which lay between them. They buried all in
the deep sea of love that was about the rock
of their passion. For, as of another Alan and
another woman, the <i>mirdhei</i> was upon them:
the dream-spell of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Day by day, with them as with that Alan
and Sorcha of whom they had often heard,
their joy had grown, like a flower moving ever
to the sun; and as it grew the roots deepened,
and the tendrils met and intertwined round
the two hearts, till at last they were drawn
together and became one, as two moving rays
of light will converge into one beam, or the
song of two singers blend and become as
the song of one.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed the wonder of the
dream became at times a brooding passion, at
times almost an ecstasy. Ossian and the
poets of old speak of a strange frenzy that
came upon the brave; and, sure, there is a
<i>mircath</i> of another kind now and again in the
world, in the green, remote places at least.
Aodh the islander, and Ian-Ban of the hills,
and other dreamer-poets know of it&mdash;the
<i>mirdhei</i>, the passion that is deeper than passion,
the dream that is beyond the dream.
This that was once the fair doom of another
Alan and Sorcha, of whom Ian had often told
him with hushed voice and dreaming eyes,
was now upon himself and Ynys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>They were Love to each other. In each
the other saw the beauty of the world. Hand
in hand they wandered among the wind-haunted
pines, or along the thyme and grass
of the summits of the precipices; or they
sailed for hours upon the summer seas, blue
lawns of moving azure, glorious with the sun-dazzle
and lovely with purple cloud-shadows
and amethystine straits of floating weed; or,
by noontide, or at the full of the moon, they
penetrated far into the dim, green arcades,
and were as shadows in a strange and fantastic
but ineffably sweet and beautiful dream.</p>

<p>Day was lovely and desirable to each, for
day dreamed to night; and night was sweet as
life because it held the new day against its
dark, beating heart. Week after week passed,
and to Ynys as to Alan it was as the going of
the gray owl's wing, swift and silent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then it was that, on a day of the days,
Alan was suddenly stricken with a new and
startling dread.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="X" id="X">CHAPTER X</a></h3>

<p class="center">AT THE EDGE OF THE SHADOW</p>


<p>In the hour that this terror came upon him
Alan was alone upon the high slopes of Rona,
where the grass fails and the moor purples at
an elevation of close on a thousand feet above
the sea.</p>

<p>The day had been cloudless since sunrise.
The immeasurable range of ocean expanded
like the single petal of an azure flower; all
of one unbroken blue save for the shadows
of the scattered isles and for the fugitive
amethyst where floating weed suspended.
An immense number of birds congregated
from every quarter. Guillemots and skuas
and puffins, cormorants and northern divers,
everywhere darted, swam, or slept upon the
listless sea, whose deep suspiration no more
than lifted a league-long calm here and
there, to lapse insensibly, even as it rose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Through the not less silent quietudes of air
the sea-gulls swept with curving flight, and
the narrow-winged terns made a constant
shimmer. At remote altitudes the gannet
motionlessly drifted. Oceanward the great
widths of calm were rent now and again by
the shoulders of the porpoises which followed
the herring trail, their huge, black revolving
bodies looming large above the silent wave.
Not a boat was visible anywhere; not even
upon the most distant horizons did a brown
sail fleck itself duskily against the skyward
wall of steely blue.</p>

<p>In the great stillness which prevailed, the
noise of the surf beating around the promontory
of Aonaig was audible as a whisper;
though even in that windless hour the indescribable
rumor of the sea, moving through
the arcades of the island, filled the hollow of
the air overhead. Ever since the early morning
Alan had moved under a strange gloom.
Out of that golden glory of midsummer a
breath of joyous life should have reached his
heart, but it was not so. For sure, there is
sometimes in the quiet beauty of summer an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
air of menace, a breath, a suspicion, a dream-premonition,
of suspended force&mdash;a force
antagonistic and terrible. All who have
lived in these lonely isles know the peculiar
intensity of this summer melancholy. No
clamor of tempestuous wind, no prolonged
sojourn of untimely rains, and no long baffling
of mists in all the drear inclemencies of that
remote region, can produce the same ominous
and even paralyzing gloom which sometimes
can be born of ineffable peace and beauty.
Is it that in the human soul there is mysterious
kinship with the outer soul which we call
Nature; and that in these few supreme hours
which come at the full of the year we are, sometimes,
suddenly aware of the tremendous forces
beneath and behind us, momently quiescent?</p>

<p>Standing with Ynys upon a grassy headland,
Alan had looked long at the dream-blue
perspectives to the southward, seeing there at
first no more than innumerable hidden pathways
of the sun, with blue-green and silver
radiance immeasurable, and the very breath
and wonder and mystery of ocean life suspended
as in a dream. In the hearts of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
deep happiness brooded. Perhaps it was out
of these depths that rose the dark flower
of this sudden apprehension that came upon
him. It was no fear for Ynys, nor for himself,
not for the general weal: but a profound
disquietude, a sense of inevitable ill.
Ynys felt the tightening of his hand; and
saw the sudden change in his face. It was
often so with him. The sun-dazzle, at which
he would look with endless delight, finding in
it a tangible embodiment of the fugitive
rhythms of cosmic music which floated everywhere,
would sometimes be a dazzle also in
his brain. In a moment a strange bewilderment
would render unstable those perilous
sands of the human brain which are forever
laved by the strange waters of the unseen
life. When this mood or fantasy, or uncalculable
accident occurred, he was often wrought
either by vivid dreams, or creative work, or
else would lapse into a melancholy from which
not even the calling love of Ynys would
arouse him. When she saw in his face and
in his eyes this sudden bewildered look, and
knew that in some mysterious way the madness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of the beauty of the sea had enthralled him, she
took his hand and moved with him inland. In
a brief while the poignant fragrance from the
trodden thyme and short hill-grass, warmed
by the sun, rose as an intoxication. For that
hour the gloom went. But when, later, he
wandered away from Caisteal-Rhona, once
more the sense of foreboding was heavy upon
him. Determined to shake it off, he wandered
high among the upland solitudes. There a
cool air forever moved even in the noons of
August; and there, indeed, at last, there
came upon him a deep peace. With joy his
mind dwelled over and over again upon all
that Ynys had been and was to him; upon the
depth and passion of their love; upon the
mystery and wonder of that coming life which
was theirs and yet was not of them, itself
already no more than an unrisen wave or an
unbloomed flower, but yet as inevitable as
they, but dowered with the light which is
beyond where the mortal shadows end.
Strange, this passion of love for what is not;
strange, this deep longing of the woman&mdash;the
longing of the womb, the longing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
heart, the longing of the brain, the longing
of the soul&mdash;for the perpetuation of the life
she shares in common with one whom she
loves; strange, this longing of the man, a
longing deep-based in his nature as the love
of life or the fear of death, for the gaining
from the woman he loves this personal hostage
against oblivion. For indeed something
of this so commonplace, and yet so divine
and mysterious tide of birth, which is forever
at the flow upon this green world, is
due to an instinctive fear of cessation. The
perpetuation of life is the unconscious protest
of humanity against the destiny of mortality.
Thoughts such as these were often with Alan
now; often, too, with Ynys, in whom, indeed,
all the latent mysticism which had ever been
a bond between them had latterly been continually
evoked. Possibly it was the mere
shadow of his great love; possibly it was
some fear of the dark way wherein the sunrise
of each new birth is involved; possibly it
was no more than the melancholy of the isles,
that so wrought him on this perfect day.
Whatsoever the reason, a deeper despondency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
prevailed as noon waned into afternoon. An
incident, deeply significant to him, in that
mood, at that time, happened then. A few
hundred yards away from where he stood,
half hidden in a little glen where a fall of
water made a continual spray among the
shadows of the rowan and birch, was the
bothie of a woman, the wife of Neil MacNeill,
a fisherman of Aonaig. She was there, he
knew, for the summer pasturing, and even as
he recollected this, he heard the sound of her
voice as she sang down somewhere by the
burnside. Moving slowly toward the corrie,
he stopped at a mountain ash which overhung
a deep pool. Looking down, he saw the
woman, Morag MacNeill, washing and peeling
potatoes in the clear brown water. And as
she washed and peeled, she sang an old-time
shealing hymn of the Virgin-Shepherdess, of
Michael the White, and of Coluaman the
Dove. It was a song that, far away in Brittany,
he had heard Lois, the mother of Ynys,
sing in one of those rare hours when her
youth came back to her with something of
youth's passionate intensity. He listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
now to every word of the doubly familiar
Gaelic, and when Morag finished the tears
were in his eyes, and he stood for a while as
one entranced.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>After she had ceased Alan found himself
repeating whisperingly, and again and again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bi'eadh an Tri-Aon leinn, a la 's a dh-oidhche!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'S air chul nan tonn, no air thaobh nam beann."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>Suddenly the woman glanced upward, perhaps
because of the shadow that moved
against the green bracken below. With a
startled gesture she sprang to her feet.
Alan looked at her kindly, saying with a
smile, "Sure, Morag nic Tormaid, it is not
fear you need be having of one who is your
friend." Then, seeing that the woman stared
at him with an intent gaze, wherein was
terror as well as surprise, he spoke to her
again.</p>

<p>"Sure, Morag, I am no stranger that you
should be looking at me with those foreign
eyes." He laughed as he spoke, and made
as though he were about to descend to
the burnside. Unmistakably, however, the
woman did not desire his company. He
saw that with the pain and bewilderment
which had come upon him whenever the
like happened, as so often it had happened
since he had come to Rona.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Bean Neil MacNeill, what is the
meaning of this strangeness that is upon you?
Why do you not speak? Why do you turn
away your head?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the woman flashed her black eyes
upon him.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of <i>am Buchaille
Bàn&mdash;am Buchaille Buidhe</i>?"</p>

<p>He looked at her in amaze. <i>Am Buchaille
Bàn!</i> ... The fair-haired Herdsman, the
yellow-haired Herdsman! What could she
mean? In days gone by, he knew, the
islanders had, in the evil time after Culloden,
so named the fugitive Prince who
had sought shelter in the Hebrides; and
in some of the runes of an older day still the
Saviour of the World was sometimes so
called, just as Mary was called <i>Bhuachaille
nan treud</i>&mdash;Shepherdess of the Flocks. But
as Alan knew well, no allusion to either of
these was intended.</p>

<p>"Who is the Herdsman of whom you speak,
Morag?"</p>

<p>"Is it no knowledge you have of him at
all, Alan MacAlasdair?"</p>

<p>"None. I know nothing of the man,
nothing of what is in your mind. Who is
the Herdsman?"</p>

<p>"You will not be putting evil upon me because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that you saw me here by the pool before
I saw you?"</p>

<p>"Why should I, woman? Why do you
think that I have the power of the evil eye?
Sure, I have done no harm to you or yours,
and wish none. But if it is for peace to you
to know it, it is no evil I wish you, but only
good. The Blessing of Himself be upon you
and yours and upon your house."</p>

<p>The woman looked relieved, but still cast
her furtive gaze upon Alan, who no longer
attempted to join her.</p>

<p>"I cannot be speaking the thing that is in
my mind, Alan MacAlasdair. It is not for
me to be saying that thing. But if you have
no knowledge of the Herdsman, sure it is
only another wonder of the wonders, and God
has the sun on that shadow, to the Stones be
it said."</p>

<p>"But tell me, Morag, who is the Herdsman
of whom you speak?"</p>

<p>For a minute or more the woman stood
regarding him intently. Then slowly, and
as with difficulty, she spoke:</p>

<p>"Why have you appeared to the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
upon the isle, sometimes by moonlight, sometimes
by day or in the dusk? and have foretold
upon one and all who dwell here black
gloom and the red flame of sorrow?&mdash;Why
have you, who are an outcast because of
what lies between you and another, pretended
to be an emissary of the Son&mdash;ay, for sure,
even, God forgive you, to be the Son himself?"</p>

<p>Alan stared at the woman in blank amaze.
For a time he could utter no word. Had
some extraordinary delusion spread among
the islanders, and was there in the insane accusation
of this woman the secret of that inexplicable
aversion which had so troubled him?</p>

<p>"This is all an empty darkness to me,
Morag. Speak more plainly, woman. What
is all this madness that you say? When have
I uttered aught of having any mission, or of
being other than I am? When have I foretold
evil upon you or yours, or upon the isles
beyond? What man has ever dared to say
that Alan MacAlasdair of Rona is an outcast?
and what sin is it that lies between me and
another of which you know?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>It was impossible for Morag MacNeill to
doubt the sincerity of the man who spoke to her.
She crossed herself, and muttered the words of
a <i>sian</i> for the protection of the soul against the
demon powers. Still, even while she believed
in Alan's sincerity, she could not reconcile it
with that terrible and strange mystery with
which rumor had filled her ears. So, having
nothing to say in reply to his eager questions,
she cast down her eyes and kept silence.</p>

<p>"Speak, Morag, for Heaven's sake! Speak
if you are a true woman; you that see a man
in sore pain, in pain, too, for that of which he
knows nothing, and of the ill of which he is
guiltless!"</p>

<p>But, keeping her face averted, the woman
muttered simply: "I have no more to say."
With that she turned and moved slowly along
the pathway which led from the pool to her
hillside bothie.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Alan turned and moved across
the moor. What wonder, he thought, that
deep gloom had been upon him that day?
Here, in the woman's mysterious words, was
the shadow of that shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly, brooding deep over what he had
heard, he traversed the Mona-nan-Con, as
the hill-tract there was called, till he came
to the rocky wilderness known as the Slope
of the Caverns.</p>

<p>There for a time he leaned against a high
bowlder, idly watching a few sheep nibbling
the short grass which grew about the apertures
of some of the many caves which disclosed
themselves in all directions. Below
and beyond, he saw the illimitable calm
beauty of the scene; southward with no break
anywhere; eastward, a sun-blaze void; south-westward,
the faint, blue film of the coast of
Ulster; westward, the same immeasurable
windless expanse. From where he stood he
could just hear the murmur of the surge
whispering all round the isle; the surge that,
even on days of profoundest calm, makes a
murmurous rumor among the rocks and
shingle of the island shores. Not upon the
moor side, but in the blank hollows of the
caves around him he heard, as in gigantic
shells, the moving of a strange and solemn
rhythm: wave haunted-shells indeed, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
echo that was bruited from one to the other
came from beneath, from out of those
labyrinthine corridors and dim, shadowy
arcades, where through the intense green
glooms the Atlantic waters lose themselves
in a vain wandering.</p>

<p>For long he leaned there, revolving in his
mind the mystery of Morag MacNeill's words.
Then, abruptly, the stillness was broken by
the sound of a dislodged stone. So little did
he expect the foot of a fellow that he did not
turn at what he thought to be the slip of a
sheep. But when upon the slope of the grass,
just beyond where he stood, a dusky blue
shadow wavered fantastically, he swung round
with a sudden instinct of dread.</p>

<p>And this was the dread which, at the end of
the third month after he and Ynys had come
to Rona, was upon Alan Carmichael.</p>

<p>For there, standing quietly by another
bowlder, at the mouth of another cave, stood
a man who was in all appearance identical
with himself. Looking at this apparition, he
beheld one of the same height as himself, with
hair of the same hue, with eyes the same, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
features the same, with the same carriage, the
same smile, even the same expression. No, it
was there, and there alone, that a difference
was.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, Alan wondered if he looked
upon his own wraith. Familiar as he was with
the legends of his people, it would be no
strange thing to him that there, upon the hillside,
should appear the phantasm of himself.
Had not old Ian MacIain&mdash;and that, too,
though far away in a strange land&mdash;seen
the death of Lois Macdonald moving upward
from her feet to her knees, from her knees to
her waist, from her waist to her neck and,
just before the end, how the shroud darkened
along the face until it hid the eyes? Had he
not often heard from her, from Ian, of the
second self which so often appears beside the
living when already the shadow of doom is
upon him whose hours are numbered? Was
this, then, the reason of what had been his
inexplicable gloom? Was he indeed at the
extreme of life; was his soul amid shallows,
already a rock upon a blank, inhospitable
shore? If not, who or what was this second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
self which leaned there negligently; looking
at him with scornfully smiling lips, but with
intent, unsmiling eyes.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, there came into his mind
this thought: How could a phantom, that was
itself intangible, throw a shadow upon the
grass, as though it were a living corporeal
being? Sure, a shadow there was indeed. It
lay between the apparition and himself. A
story heard in boyhood came back to him;
instinctively he stooped and lifted a stone
and flung it midway into the shadow.</p>

<p>"Go back into the darkness," he cried,
"if out of the darkness you came; but,
if you be a living thing, put out your
hands!"</p>

<p>The shadow remained motionless; though
when Alan looked again at his second self, he
saw that the scorn which had been upon the
lips was now in the eyes also. Ay, for sure,
that was scornful laughter that lay in those
cold wells of light. No phantom that; a man
he, even as Alan himself. His heart pulsed
like that of a trapped bird, but, even in the
speaking, his courage came back to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked in a low voice that
was strange even in his own ears.</p>

<p>"Am Buchaille", replied the man in a voice
as low and strange. "I am the Herdsman."</p>

<p>A new tide of fear surged in upon Alan.
That voice, was it not his own; that tone,
was it not familiar in his ears? When the
man spoke, he heard himself speak; sure, if
he were am Buchaille Bàn, Alan, too, was
the Herdsman&mdash;though what fantastic destiny
might be his was all unknown to him.</p>

<p>"Come near," said the man, and now
the mocking light in his eyes was lambent as
cloud-fire&mdash;"come near, oh, Buchaille Bàn!"</p>

<p>With a swift movement Alan leapt forward,
but as he leaped his foot caught in a spray
of heather and he stumbled and nigh fell.
When he recovered himself, he looked in
vain for the man who had called him. There
was not a sign, not a trace of any living
being. For the first few moments he believed
it had all been a delusion. Mortal being did
not appear and vanish in that ghostly way.
Still, surely he could not have mistaken the
blank of that place for a speaking voice, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
out of nothingness have fashioned the living
phantom of himself? Or could he? With
that, he strode forward and peered into the
wide arch of the cavern by which the man
had stood. He could not see far into it, but
so far as it was possible to see, he discerned
neither man nor shadow of man, nor any thing
that stirred; no, not even the dust of a
bearnan-Bride, that grew on a patch of grass
a yard or two within the darkness, had lost one
of its aërial pinions. He drew back, dismayed.
Then, suddenly, his heart leapt again, for,
beyond all question, all possible doubt, there,
in the bent thyme, just where the man had
stood, was the imprint of his feet. Even
now the green sprays were moving forward.</p>

<h3><a name="XI" id="XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h3>

<p class="center">MYSTERY</p>


<p>An hour passed, and Alan Carmichael
still stood by the entrance to the cave. So
immovable was he that a ewe, listlessly wandering
there in search of cooler grass, lay
down after a while, drowsily regarding him
with her amber-colored eyes. All his thought
was intent upon the mystery of what he had
seen. No delusion this, he was sure. That
was a man whom he had seen. It might well
have been some one whom he did not know,
though that were unlikely, of course, for on
so small an island, inhabited by less than a
score of crofters, it was scarcely possible for
one to live there for many weeks and not
know the name and face of every soul upon
the isle. Still, a stranger might have come.
Only, if this were so, why should he call
himself the Herdsman? There was but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
herdsman on Rona, and he Angus MacCormic,
who lived at Einaval on the north side. In
these outer isles, the shepherd and the herdsman
are appointed by the community, and no
man is allowed to be one or the other at will,
any more than to be <i>maor</i> or <i>constabal</i>. Then,
too, if this man were indeed herdsman, where
was his <i>imir ionailt</i>, his browsing tract?
Looking round him, Alan could perceive
nowhere any fitting pasture. Surely no
herdsman would be content with such an
<i>imir a bhuchaille</i>&mdash;rig of the herdsman&mdash;as
that rocky wilderness where the soft green
grass grew in patches under this or that
bowlder, on the sun side of this or that
mountain ash. Again, he had given no
name, but called himself simply <i>Am Buchaille</i>.
This was how the woman Morag had spoken;
did she indeed mean this very man, and if so
what import lay in her words? But far
beyond all other bewilderment for him was
that strange, that indeed terrifying likeness
to himself; a likeness so absolute, so convincing,
that he knew he might himself easily
have been deceived, had he beheld the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
apparition in any place where it was possible
that a reflection could have misled him.</p>

<p>Brooding thus, eye and ear were both intent
for the faintest sight or sound. But, from
the interior of the cavern, not a breath came.
Once, from among the jagged rocks high on
the west slope of Ben Einaval he fancied he
heard an unwonted sound: that of human
laughter, but laughter so wild, so remote, so
unmirthful, that fear was in his heart. It
could not be other than imagination, he said
to himself; for in that lonely place there was
none to wander idly at that season, and none
who, wandering, would laugh there, solitary.</p>

<p>It was with an effort that Alan at last
determined to probe the mystery. Stooping,
he moved cautiously into the cavern, and
groped his way along a narrow ledge which
led, as he thought, into another larger cave.
But this proved to be one of the innumerable
hollow corridors which intersect the honeycombed
slopes of this Isle of Caves. To
wander far in these lightless passages would
be to court inevitable death. Long ago, the
piper whom the Prionnsa-Ban, the Fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Prince, loved to hear in his exile,&mdash;he that was
called Rory McVurich,&mdash;penetrated one of the
larger hollows to seek there for a child that
had idly wandered into the dark. Some of
the clansmen, with the father and mother of
the little one, waited at the entrance to the
cave. For a time there was silence; then, as
agreed upon, the sound of the pipes was
heard, to which a man named Lachlan McLachlan
replied from the outer air. The
skirl of the pipes within grew fainter and
fainter. Louder and louder Lachlan played
upon his <i>chantar</i>; shriller and shriller grew
the wild cry of the <i>feadan</i>; but for all that,
fainter and fainter waned the sound of the
pipes of Rory McVurich. Generations have
come and gone upon the isle, and still no man
has heard the returning air which Rory was
to play. He may have found the little child,
but he never found his backward path, and in
the gloom of that honeycombed hill he and
the child and the music of the pipes lapsed
into the same stillness. Remembering this
legend, familiar to him since his boyhood,
Alan did not dare to venture farther. At any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
moment, too, he knew he might fall into one
of the innumerable crevices which opened into
the sea-corridors hundreds of feet below.
Ancient rumor had it that there were mysterious
passages from the upper heights of Ben
Einaval, which led into the intricate heart
mazes of these perilous arcades. But for
a time he lay still, straining every sense. Convinced
at last that the man whom he sought
had evaded all possible quest, he turned
to regain the light. Brief way as he had
gone, this was no easy thing to do. For a
few moments, indeed, Alan lost his self-possession,
when he found a uniform dusk about
him, and could scarce discern which of the
several branching narrow corridors was that
by which he had come. But following the
greener light, he reached the cave, and soon,
with a sigh of relief, was upon the sun-sweet
warm earth again.</p>

<p>How more than ever beautiful the world
seemed to him; how sweet upon the eyes
were cliff and precipice, the wide stretch of
ocean, the flying birds, the sheep grazing on
the scanty pastures, and, above all, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
homely blue smoke curling faintly upward
from the fisher crofts on the headland east of
Aonaig!</p>

<p>Purposely he retraced his steps by the way
of the glen. He would see the woman,
Morag MacNeill again, and insist on some
more explicit word; but when he reached the
burnside once more, the woman was not
there. Possibly she had seen him coming,
and guessed his purpose; half he surmised
this, for the peats in the hearth were brightly
aglow, and on the hob beside them the boiling
water hissed in a great iron pot wherein were
potatoes. In vain he sought, in vain called.
Impatient at last he walked around the bothie
and into the little byre beyond. The
place seemed deserted. The matter, small
as it was, added to his profound disquietude.
Resolved to sift the mystery, he began to
walk swiftly down the slope. By the old
shealing of Cnoc-na-Monie, now forsaken, his
heart leaped at sight of Ynys coming to
meet him. At first he thought he would say
nothing of what had happened. But with
Ynys his was ever an impossible silence, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
she knew every change in his mind as a seaman
knows the look of the sky and sea. Moreover,
she had herself been all day oppressed
by something of the same inexplicable apprehension.</p>

<p>When they met, she put her hands on his
shoulders and looked at him lovingly with
questioning eyes. Ah! he found rest and hope
in those deep pools of quiet light whence the
dreaming love rose comfortingly to meet his
own yearning gaze.</p>

<p>"What is it, Alan, mo-ghray; what is the
trouble that is upon you?"</p>

<p>"It is a trouble, Ynys, but one of which I
can speak little, for it is little I know."</p>

<p>"Have you heard or seen aught that gives
you fear?"</p>

<p>"I have seen a man here upon Rona whom
I have not seen or met before, and it is one
whose face is known to me, and whose voice
too, and one whom I would not meet again."</p>

<p>"Did he give you no name, Alan?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Whence did he come? Whither did
he go?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"He came out of the shadow, and into the
shadow he went."</p>

<p>Ynys looked steadfastly at her husband; her
wistful gaze searching deep into his unquiet
eyes, and thence from feature to feature of
the face which had become strangely worn,
for all the joy that lay between them.</p>

<p>But she said no more upon what he had
told her.</p>

<p>"I, too, Alan mo rùn, have heard a strange
thing to-day. You know old Marsail Macrae?
She is ill now with a slow fever, and she thinks
that the shadow which she saw lying upon her
hearth last Sabbath, when nothing was there
to cause any shadow, was her own death,
come for her, and now waiting there. I spoke
to the old woman comfortingly, but she would
not have peace, and her eyes looked at me
strangely.</p>

<p>"'What is it, Marsail?' I asked at last. To
which she replied mysteriously:</p>

<p>"'Ay, ay, for sure, it was I who saw you
first.'</p>

<p>"'Saw me first, Marsail?'</p>

<p>"'Ay, you and Alan MacAlasdair.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"'When and where was this sight upon you
that you speak of?'</p>

<p>"'It was one month before you and he
came to Rona.'</p>

<p>"This startled me, and I asked her to tell
me her meaning. At first, I could make little
of what was said, for she muttered low, and
moved her head idly this way and that; moaning
in her pain. But on my taking her hand,
she looked at me again; and then, apparently
without an effort, told me this thing:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"'On the seventh day of the month before
you came&mdash;and by the same token it was on
the seventh day of the month following that
you and Alan MacAlasdair came to Caisteal-Rhona&mdash;I
was upon the shore at Aonaig, listening
to the crying of the wind against the great
precipice of Biolacreag. With me were Roderick
Macrea and Neil MacNeill, Morag MacNeill,
and her sister Elsa; and we were singing
the hymn for those who were out on the wild
sea that was roaring white against the cliffs of
Berneray; for some of our people were there,
and we feared for them. Sometimes one sang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and sometimes another. And sure, it is remembering
I am, how, when I had called out
with my old wailing voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Boidh an Tri-aon leinn, a la 's a dh-oidche;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'S air chul nan tonn, no air thaobh nam beann.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">[Be the Three-in-One with us day and night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the crested wave, when waves run high.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'I had just sung this, and we were all
listening to the sound of it caught by the wind
and whirled up against the black face of Biolacreag,
when suddenly I saw a boat come sailing
quite into the haven. I called out to
those about me, but they looked at me with
white faces, for no boat was there, and it was
a rough, wild sea it was in that haven.</p>

<p>"'And in that boat I saw three people sitting,
and one was you, Ynys nighean Lhois,
and one was Alan MacAlasdair, and one was a
man who had his face in shadow, and his eyes
looked into the shadow at his feet. I knew
not who you were, nor whence you came, nor
whether it was for Rona you were, nor any
thing at all; but I saw you clear, and I told
those about me what I saw. And Seumas MacNeill,
him that is dead now, and brother to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Neil here at Aonaig, he said to me, "Who
was that whom you saw walking in the dusk
the night before last?" "Alasdair MacAlasdair
Carmichael," answered one at that.
Seumas muttered, looking at those about him,
"Mark what I say, for it is a true thing; that
Alasdair Carmichael of Rona is dead now, because
Marsail here saw him walking in the
dusk when he was not upon the island; and
now, you Neil, and you Roderick, and all of
you will be for thinking with me that the man
and the woman in the boat whom Marsail sees
now will be the son and the daughter of him
who has changed."</p>

<p>"'Well, well, it is a true thing that we each
of us thought that thought, but when the
days went and nothing more came of it, the
memory of the seeing went too. Then there
came the day when the cobble of Aulay MacAulay
came out of Borosay into Caisteal-Rhona
haven. Glad we were to see the face
of Ian mac Iain again, and to hear the sob of
joy coming out of the heart of Kirsten, his
sister: but when you and Alan MacAlasdair
came on shore, it was my voice that then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
from mouth to mouth, for I whispered to
Morag MacNeill who was next me, that you
were the twain that I had seen in the boat.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well, Alan," Ynys added, with a grave
smile, "I spoke gently to old Marsail, and
told her that after all there was no evil in
that seeing, and that for sure it was nothing
at all, at all, to see two people in a boat, and
nothing coming of that, save happiness for
those two, and glad content to be here, with
hope like a white swallow nesting for aye
under the eaves of our house.</p>

<p>"Marsail looked at me with big eyes.</p>

<p>"'It is no white swallow that builds there,
Ynys Bean Alan,' she said.</p>

<p>"But when I asked her what she meant by
that, she would say no more. No asking of
mine would bring the word to her lips; only
she shook her head and averted her gaze from
my face. Then, seeing that it was useless, I
said to her:</p>

<p>"'Marsail, tell me this: was that sight of
yours the sole thing that made the people here
on Rona look askance at Alan MacAlasdair?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"For a time she stared at me with the dim,
unrecognizing eyes of those who are ill and
in the shadow of death; then, suddenly they
brightened, and she spoke:</p>

<p>"'It is not all.'</p>

<p>"'Then what more is there, Marsail
Macrae?'</p>

<p>"'That is not for the saying. I have no
more to say. Let you, or your man, go elsewhere;
that which is to be, will be. To each
his own end.'</p>

<p>"'Then tell me this at least,' I asked; 'is
there peril for Alan or for me in this island?'</p>

<p>"But from that moment Marsail would say
no more, and indeed I saw that a swoon was
upon the old woman, and that she heard not
or saw not."</p>

<p>After this, Ynys and Alan walked slowly
home together, hand in hand, both silent and
revolving in their mind as in a dim dusk, that
mystery which, vague and unreal at first, had
now become a living presence, and haunted
them by day and night.</p>

<h3><a name="XII" id="XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h3>

<p class="center">IN THE GREEN ARCADES</p>


<p>"In the shadow of pain, one may hear the
footsteps of joy." So runs a proverb of
old.</p>

<p>It was a true saying for Alan and Ynys.
That night they lay down in pain, their hearts
heavy with the weight of some burden which
they felt and did not know. On the morrow
they woke to the rapture of a new day&mdash;a day
of absolute beauty, when the stars grew pale
in the cloudless blue sky before the uprising
of the sun, while the last vapor lifted a white
wing from the sea, and a dim spiral mist carried
skyward the memory of inland dews. The
whole wide wilderness of ocean was of living
azure, aflame with gold and silver. Around
the promontories of the isles the brown-sailed
fish-boats of Barra and Berneray, of Borosay
and Seila, moved blithely hither and thither.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Everywhere the rhythm of life pulsed swift
and strong. The first sound which had awakened
the sleepers was of a loud singing of
fishermen who were putting out from Aonaig.
The coming of a great shoal of mackerel had
been signalled, and every man and woman of
the near isles was alert for the take. The
first sign had been the swift congregation of
birds, particularly the gannets and skuas.
And as the men pulled at the oars, or hoisted
the brown sails, they sang a snatch of an old-world
tune, wont to be chanted at the first
coming of the birds when spring-tide is on the
flow again.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Eager to be of help, Alan put off in his boat
and was soon among the fishermen, who in
their new excitement were forgetful of all else
than that the mackerel were come, and that
every moment was precious. For the first
time Alan found himself no unwelcome comrade.
Was it, he wondered, because that,
there upon the sea, whatever of shadow
dwelled about him on the land was no longer
visible?</p>

<p>All through that golden noon, he and the
others worked hard. From isle to isle went
the chorus of the splashing oars and splashing
nets; of the splashing of the fish and the
splashing of gannets and gulls; of the splashing
of the tide leaping blithely against the sun-dazzle,
and the innumerous rippling wash
moving out of the west&mdash;all this blent with
the loud, joyous cries, the laughter, and the
hoarse shouts of the men of Barra and the adjacent
islands. It was close upon dusk before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the Rona boats put into the haven of Aonaig
again; and by that time none was blither than
Alan Carmichael, who in that day of happy
toil had lost all the gloom and apprehension
of the day before, and now made haste to
Caisteal-Rhona to add to his joy by a sight of
Ynys in their home.</p>

<p>When, however, he got there, there was no
Ynys to see. "She had gone," said Kirsten
Macdonald, "she had gone out in the smaller
boat midway in the afternoon, and had sailed
around to Aoidhu, the great scaur which ran
out beyond the precipices at the south-west of
Rona."</p>

<p>This Ynys often did; and, of late, more and
more often. Ever since she had come to the
Hebrid Isles, her love of the sea had deepened,
and had grown into a passion for its mystery
and beauty. Of late, too, something impelled
to a more frequent isolation; a deep longing
to be where no eye could see, and no ear
hearken. Those strange dreams which, in a
confused way, had haunted her mind in her
far Breton home, came oftener now and more
clear. Sometimes, when she had sat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
twilight at Kerival, holding her mother's hand
and listening to tales of that remote North to
which her heart had ever yearned, she had
suddenly lost all consciousness of the speaker,
or of the things said, and had let her mind be
taken captive by her uncontrolled imagination,
till in spirit she was far away, and sojourned
in strange places, hearing a language that she
did not know, and yet which she understood,
and dwelt in a past or a present which she
had never seen and which yet was familiar.</p>

<p>Since Ynys had known she was with child,
this visionariness had been intensified, this
longing had become more and more a deep
need. Even with Alan she felt at times the
intrusion of an alien influence. If in her
body was a mystery, a mystery also was in
her brain and in her heart.</p>

<p>Alan knew this, and knowing, understood.
It was for gladness to him that Ynys should
do as she would; that in these long hours of
solitude she drank deep of the elixir of peace;
and that this way of happiness was open to her
as to him. Never did these isolations come
between them; indeed they were sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
more at one then than when they were together,
for all the deep happiness which sustained both
upon the strong waters of their love.</p>

<p>So, when Alan heard from Kirsten that
Ynys had sailed westward, he was in no way
alarmed. But when the sun had set, and over
the faint blue film of the Isle of Tiree the
moon had risen, and still no sign of Ynys, he
became restless and uneasy. Kirsten begged
him in vain to eat of the supper she had prepared.
Idly he moved to and fro along the
rocky ledge, or down by the pebbly shore, or
across the green <i>airidh</i>; eager for a glimpse
of her whom he loved so passing well.</p>

<p>At last, unable longer to endure a growing
anxiety, he put out in his boat, and sailed
swiftly before the slight easterly breeze which
had prevailed since moonrise. So far as
Aoidhu, all the way from Aonaig, there was
not a haven anywhere, nor even one of the
sea caverns which honeycombed the isle
beyond the headland. A glance, therefore,
showed him that Ynys had not yet come
back that way. It was possible, though unlikely,
that she had sailed right round Rona;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
unlikely because in the narrow straits to the
north, between Rona and the scattered islets
known as the Innse-mhara, strong currents
prevailed, and particularly at the full of the
tide, when they swept north-eastward, dark
and swift as a mill-race.</p>

<p>Once the headland was passed and the sheer
precipitous westward cliffs loomed black out
of the sea, he became more and more uneasy.
As yet, there was no danger; but he saw that
a swell was moving out of the west, and whenever
the wind blew that way the sea arcades
were filled with a lifting, perilous wave, and
escape from them was difficult and often
impossible. Out of the score or more great
corridors which opened between Aoidhu
and Ardgorm, it was difficult to know into
which to hazard entry in quest of Ynys.
Together they had examined all of them.
Some twisted but slightly; others wound
sinuously till the green, serpentine alleys,
flanked by basalt walls hundreds of feet high,
lost themselves in an indistinguishable maze.</p>

<p>But that which was safest, and wherein a
boat could most easily make its way against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
wind or tide, was the huge, cavernous corridor
known locally as the Uamh-nan-roin, the Cave
of the Seals.</p>

<p>For this opening Alan steered his boat.
Soon he was within the wide corridor. Like
the great cave at Staffa, it was wrought as
an aisle in some natural cathedral; the rocks,
too, were fluted columnarly and rose in flawless
symmetry as though graven by the hand
of man. At the far end of this gigantic aisle,
there diverges a long, narrow arcade, filled by
day with the green shine of the water, and
by night, when the moon is up, with a pale
froth of light. It is one of the few where
there are open gateways for the sea and
the wandering light, and, by its spherical
shape, almost the only safe passage in a season
of heavy wind. Half-way along this
arched arcade a corridor leads to a round
cup-like cavern, midway in which stands a
huge mass of black basalt, in shape suggestive
of a titanic altar. Thus it must have
impressed the imagination of the islanders
of old, for by them, even in a remote
day, it was called Teampull-nan-Mhara, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Temple of the Sea. Owing to the narrowness
of the corridor, and to the smooth,
unbroken walls which rise sheer from the
green depths into an invisible darkness, the
Strait of the Temple is not one wherein to
linger long, save in a time of calm.</p>

<p>Instinctively, however, Alan quietly headed
his boat along this narrow way. When,
silently, he emerged from the arcade, he
could just discern the mass of basalt at the
far end of the cavern. But there, seated in
her boat, was Ynys; apparently idly adrift,
for one oar floated in the water alongside, and
the other suspended listlessly from the tholes.</p>

<p>His heart had a suffocating grip as he saw
her whom he had come to seek. Why that
absolute stillness, that strange, listless indifference?
For a dreadful moment he feared
that death had indeed come to her in that
lonely place where, as an ancient legend had
it, a woman of old time had perished, and
ever since had wrought death upon any who
came thither solitary and unhappy.</p>

<p>But at the striking of the shaft of his oar
against a ledge, Ynys gave a low cry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
looked at him with startled eyes. Half rising
from where she crouched in the stern, she
called to him in a voice that had in it something
strangely unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"I will not hear!" she cried. "I will not
hear! Leave me! Leave me!"</p>

<p>Fearing that the desolation of the place
had wrought upon her mind, Alan swiftly
moved toward her. The very next moment
his boat glided along hers. Stepping from
the one to the other, he kneeled beside
her.</p>

<p>"<i>Ynys-ghaolaiche</i>, Ynys, my darling, what
is it? what gives you dread? There is no
harm here. All is well. Look! See, it is I,
Alan; Alan, whom you love! Listen, dear;
do you not know me; do you not know
who I am? It is I, Alan; Alan who loves
you!"</p>

<p>Even in that obscure light he could clearly
discern her pale face, and his heart smote
him as he saw her eyes turn upon him with a
glance wild and mournful. Had she indeed
succumbed to the sea madness which ever and
again strikes into a terrible melancholy one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
here and there among those who dwell in the
remote isles? But even as he looked, he
noted another expression come into the
beautiful eyes, and almost before he realized
what had happened, Ynys's head was on his
breast, and she sobbing with a sudden gladness
and passion of relief.</p>

<p>The dusk deepened swiftly. In those
serpentine arcades darkness grows from hour
to hour, even on nights when the moon makes
the outer sea a blaze of silver fire. But
sweet it was to lie there in that solitary place,
where no sound penetrated save the low,
soughing sigh of ocean, audible there only
as the breath of a sleeper: to lie there
in each other's arms, and to feel the beating
of heart against heart, knowing that
whether in the hazard of life or death, all
was well, since they two were there and
together.</p>

<p>For long Ynys could say no word. And as
for Alan&mdash;too glad was he to have her again,
to know that she lived indeed, and that his
fear of the sea madness was an idle fantasy;
too glad was he to urge her to speak, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
her recovered joy was still sweet in her heart.
But at last she whispered to him how that
she had sailed westward from Caisteal-Rhona,
having been overcome by the beauty of the
day, and longing to be among those mysterious
green arcades where thought rose out of
the mind like a white bird and flew among
shadows in strange places, bringing back with
it upon its silent wings the rumor of strange
voices, and oftentimes singing a song of what
ears hear not. Deeply upon the two had lain
the thought of what was to be; the thought
of the life she bore within her, that was the
tangible love of her and of Alan, and yet was
so strangely and remotely dissociate from
either. Happy in happy thoughts, and
strangely wrought by vague imaginings, she
had sailed past precipice after precipice, and
so at last into the Strait of the Temple. Just
before the last light of day had begun to glide
out of the pale green water, she had let her
boat drift idly alongside the Teampull-Mhara.
There, for a while, she had lain, drowsily content,
dreaming her dream. Then, suddenly
her heart had given a leap like a doe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
bracken, and the pulses in her veins swung
like stars on a night of storm.</p>

<p>For there, in that nigh unreachable and
forever unvisited solitude was the figure of a
man. He stood on the summit of the huge
basalt altar, and appeared to have sprung from
out the rock, or, himself a shadowy presence,
to have grown out of the obscure unrealities
of the darkness. She had stared at
him, fascinated, speechless.</p>

<p>When she had said this Ynys stopped
abruptly, for she felt the trembling of Alan's
hand.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said hoarsely, "go on. Tell
me all!"</p>

<p>To his amaze, she did not seem perturbed
in the way he had dreaded when she began to
tell what she had seen.</p>

<p>"But did you notice nothing about him,
Ynys ... about his face, his features?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His eyes filled me with strange joy."</p>

<p>"With joy? Oh, Ynys! Ynys! do you know
whom&mdash;<i>what</i>&mdash;it was you saw? It was a vision,
a nothingness, a mere phantom; and that
phantom was ... was ... myself!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"You, Alan! Oh, no, Alan-aghray! dear,
you do not know whom I saw&mdash;nor do I,
though I know it was not you!"</p>

<p>"We will talk of this later, my fawn," Alan
muttered. "Meanwhile, hold on to this
ledge, for I wish to examine this mass of rock
that they call the Altar."</p>

<p>With a spring he was on the ledge. Then,
swift and sure as a wild-cat, he scaled the
huge bowlder.</p>

<p>Nothing; no one! There was not a trace
of any human being. Not a bird, not a bat;
nothing. Moreover, even in that slowly
blackening darkness he could see that there
was no direct connection between the summit
or side with the blank, precipitous wall of
basalt beyond. Overhead there was, so far as
he could discern, a vault. No human being
could have descended through that perilous
gulf.</p>

<p>Was the island haunted? he wondered, as
slowly he made his way back to the boat. Or
had he been startled into some wild fantasy,
and imagined a likeness where none had been?
Perhaps, even, he had not really seen any one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
He had read of similar strange delusions.
The nerves can soon chase the mind into the
dark zone wherein it loses itself.</p>

<p>Or was Ynys the vain dreamer? That, indeed,
might well be, and she with child, and
ever a visionary. Mayhap she had heard
some fantastic tale from Morag MacNeill or
from old Marsail Macrae; the islanders had
<i>sgeul</i> after <i>sgeul</i> of a wild strangeness.</p>

<p>In silence he guided the boats back into the
outer arcade, where a faint sheen of moonlight
glistered on the water. Thence, in a few
minutes, he oared that wherein he and Ynys
sat, with the other fastened astern, into the
open.</p>

<p>When the moonshine lay full on her face,
he saw that she was thinking neither of him
nor of where she was. Her eyes were heavy
with dream.</p>

<p>What wind there was blew against their
course, so Alan rowed unceasingly. In silence
they passed once again the headland of Aoidhu;
in silence they drifted past a single light
gleaming in a croft near Aonaig&mdash;a red eye
staring out into the shadow of the sea, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the room where the woman Marsail lay dying;
and in silence their keels grided on the patch
of shingle in Caisteal-Rhona haven.</p>

<p>But when, once more, Alan found himself
with Ynys in the safe quietudes of the haven,
he pressed her eagerly to give him some clear
description of the figure she had seen.</p>

<p>Ynys, however, had become strangely reticent.
All he could elicit from her was that
the man whom she had seen bore no resemblance
to him, except in so far as he was fair.
He was taller, slimmer, and seemed older.</p>

<p>He thought it wiser not to speak to her on
what he himself had seen, or concerning his
conviction that it was the same mysterious
stranger who had appeared to both.</p>

<h3><a name="XIII" id="XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE MESSAGE</p>


<p>For days thereafter Alan haunted that
rocky, cavernous wilderness where he had
seen the Herdsman.</p>

<p>It was in vain he had everywhere sought
to find word of this mysterious dweller in
those upland solitudes. At times he believed
that there was indeed some one upon the
island of whom, for inexplicable reasons,
none there would speak; but at last he came
to the conviction that what he had seen was
an apparition, projected by the fantasy of
overwrought nerves. Even from the woman,
Morag MacNeill, to whom he had gone with a
frank appeal that won its way to her heart, he
learned no more than that an old legend, of
which she did not care to speak, was in some
way associated with his own coming to Rona.</p>

<p>Ynys, too, never once alluded to the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
incident of the green arcades which had
so deeply impressed them both; never, that
is, after the ensuing day which followed, when,
simply and spontaneously, she told Alan that
she believed that she had seen a vision. When
he reminded her that she had been convinced
of its reality, Ynys answered that for days past
she had been dreaming a strange dream, and
that doubtless this had possessed her so that
her nerves played her false, in that remote
and shadowy place. What this dream was she
would not confide, nor did he press her.</p>

<p>But as the days went by and as no word
came to either of any unknown person who
was on the island, and as Alan, for all his
patient wandering and furtive quest, both
among the upland caves and in the green
arcades, found absolutely no traces of him
whom he sought, the belief that he had been
duped by his imagination deepened almost to
conviction.</p>

<p>As for Ynys, day after day, soft veils of
dream obscured the bare realities of life. But
she, unlike Alan, became more and more convinced
that what she had seen was indeed no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
apparition. Whatever lingering doubt she
had was dissipated on the eve of the night
when old Marsail Macrae died. It was dusk
when word came to Caisteal-Rhona that
Marsail felt the cold wind on the soles of her
feet. Ynys went to her at once, and it was
in the dark hour which followed that she
heard once more and more fully the strange
story which, like a poisonous weed, had taken
root in the minds of the islanders. Already
from Marsail she had heard of the Prophet,
though, strangely enough, she had never
breathed word of this to Alan, not even when,
after the startling episode of the apparition
in the Teampull-Mhara, she had, as she believed,
seen the Prophet himself. But there
in the darkness of the low, turfed cottage, with
no light in the room save the dull red gloom
from the heart of the smoored peats, Marsail,
in the attenuated, remote voice of those who
have already entered into the vale of the
shadow, told her this thing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Yes, Ynys, wife of Alan MacAlasdair, I
will be telling you this thing before I change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
You are for knowing, sure, that long ago
Uilleam, brother of him who was father to
your man, had a son? Yes, you know that,
you say, and also that he was called Donnacha
Bàn? No, mo-run-geal, that is not a true
thing that you have heard, that Donnacha Bàn
went under the wave years ago. He was the
seventh son, and was born under the full
moon; 'tis Himself will be knowing whether
that was for or against him. Of these seven
none lived beyond childhood except the two
youngest, Kenneth and Donnacha. Kenneth
was always frail as a February flower, but he
lived to be a man. He and his brother never
spoke, for a feud was between them, not only
because that each was unlike the other and
that the younger hated the older because thus
he was the penniless one&mdash;but most because
both loved the same woman. I will not be
telling you the whole story now, for the
breath in my body will soon blow out in the
draught that is coming upon me; but this I
will say to you: darker and darker grew
the gloom between these brothers. When
Kirsteen Macdonald gave her love to Kenneth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Donnacha disappeared for a time. Then,
one day, he came back to Borosay, and
smiled quietly with his cold eyes when they
wondered at his coming again. Now, too, it
was noticed that he no longer had an ill-will
upon his brother, but spoke smoothly with
him and loved to be in his company. But, to
this day, no one knows for sure what happened.
For there was a gloaming when Donnacha
Bàn came back alone, in his sailing
boat. He and Kenneth had sailed forth, he
said, to shoot seals in the sea arcades to the
west of Rona; but in these dark and lonely
passages, they had missed each other. At
last he had heard Kenneth's voice calling for
help, but when he had got to the place, it was
too late, for his brother had been seized with
the cramps, and had sunk deep into the
fathomless water. There is no getting a
body again that sinks in these sea galleries.
The crabs know that.</p>

<p>"Well, this and much more was what Donnacha
Bàn told to his people. None believed
him; but what could any do? There was no
proof; none had ever seen them enter the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
caves together. Not that Donnacha Bàn
sought in any way to keep back those who
would fain know more. Not so; he strove to
help to find the body. Nevertheless, none
believed; and Kirsteen nic Dugall Mòr least
of all. The blight of that sorrow went to her
heart. She had death soon, poor thing! but
before the cold grayness was upon her, she
told her father, and the minister that was
there, that she knew Donnacha Bàn had
murdered his brother. One might be saying
these were the wild words of a woman; but,
for sure, no one said that thing upon Borosay
or Rona, or any of these isles. When all was
done, the minister told what he knew, and
what he thought, to the Lord of the South
Isles, and asked what was to be put upon
Donnacha Bàn. 'Exile forever,' said the
Chief, 'or if he stays here, the doom of
silence. Let no man or woman speak to him
or give him food or drink; or give him
shelter, or let his shadow cross his or hers.'</p>

<p>"When this thing was told to Donnacha
Bàn Carmichael, he laughed at first; but as
day slid over the rocks where all days fall, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
laughed no more. Soon he saw that the
Chief's word was no empty word; and yet he
would not go away from his own place. He
could not stay upon Borosay, for his father
cursed him; and no man can stay upon the
island where a father's curse moves this way
and that, forever seeking him. Then, some
say a madness came upon him, and others that
he took wildness to be his way, and others
that God put upon him the shadow of loneliness,
so that he might meet sorrow there and
repent. Howsoever that may be, Donnacha
Bàn came to Rona, and, by the same token, it
was the year of the great blight, when the
potatoes and the corn came to naught, and
when the fish in the sea swam away from the
isles. In the autumn of that year there was
not a soul left on Rona except Kirsten Macdonald
and the old man Ian, her father, who
had guard of Caisteal-Rhona for him who was
absent. When, once more, smoke rose from
the crofts, the rumor spread that Donnacha
Bàn, the murderer, had made his home among
the caves of the upper part of the isle. None
knew how this rumor rose, for he was seen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
none. The last man who saw him&mdash;and that
was a year later&mdash;was old Padruic McVurich,
the shepherd. Padruic said that, as he was
driving his ewes across the north slope of Ben
Einaval in the gloaming, he came upon a silent
figure seated upon a rock, with his chin in his
hands, and his elbows on his knees&mdash;with the
great, sad eyes of him staring at the moon that
was lifting itself out of the sea. Padruic did
not know who the man was. The shepherd
had few wits, poor man! and he had known, or
remembered, little about the story of Donnacha
Bàn Carmichael, so, when he spoke to
the man, it was as to a stranger. The man
looked at him and said:</p>

<p>"'You are Padruic McVurich, the shepherd.'</p>

<p>"At that a trembling was upon old Padruic,
who had the wonder that this stranger should
know who and what he was.</p>

<p>"'And who will you be, and forgive the saying?'
he asked.</p>

<p>"'<i>Am Faidh</i>&mdash;the Prophet,' the man said.</p>

<p>"'And what prophet will you be, and what
is your prophecy?' asked Padruic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I am here because I wait for what is to
be, and that will be for the birth of a child
that is to be a king.'</p>

<p>"And with that the man said no more, and
the old shepherd went silently down through
the hillside gloaming, and, heavy with the
thoughts that troubled him, followed his ewes
down into Aonaig. But after that neither he
nor any other saw or heard aught of the
shadowy stranger; so that all upon Rona felt
sure that Padruic had beheld no more than a
vision. There were some who thought that
he had seen the ghost of the outlaw Donnacha
Bàn; and mayhap one or two who wondered if
the stranger that had said he was a prophet
was not Donnacha Bàn himself, with a madness
come upon him; but at last these rumors
went out to sea upon the wind, and men forgot.
But, and it was months and months
afterward, and three days before his own
death, old Padruic McVurich was sitting in
the sunset on the rocky ledge in front of his
brother's croft, where then he was staying,
when he heard a strange crying of seals.
He thought little of that; only, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
looked closer, he saw, in the hollow of the
wave hard by that ledge, a drifting body.</p>

<p>"<i>Am Faidh&mdash;Am Faidh!</i>" he cried; "the
Prophet, the Prophet!"</p>

<p>At that his brother and his brother's wife
ran to see; but it was nothing that they saw.
"It would be a seal," said Pol McVurich; but
at that Padruic had shook his head, and said
no, for sure, he had seen the face of the dead
man, and it was of him whom he had met on
the hillside, and that had said he was the
Prophet who was waiting there for the birth
of a king.</p>

<p>"And that is how there came about the echo
of the thought, that Donnacha Bàn had at
last, after his madness, gone under the green
wave and was dead. For all that, in the
months which followed, more than one man
said he had caught a glimpse of a figure high
up on the hill. The old wisdom says that
when Christ comes again, or the Prophet who
will herald Christ, it will be as a herdsman on
a lonely isle. More than one of the old
people on Rona and Borosay remembered that
<i>sgeul</i> out of the <i>seanachas</i> that the tale-tellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
knew. There were some who said that Donnacha
Bàn had never been drowned at all, and
that he was this Prophet, this Herdsman.
Others would not have that saying at all, but
believed that the mysterious herdsman was
indeed Am Buchaille Bàn, the Fair-haired
Shepherd, who had come again to redeem the
people out of their sorrow. There were even
those who said that the Herdsman who
haunted Rona was no other than Kenneth
Carmichael himself, who had not died, but had
had the mind-dark there in the sea caves
where he had been lost, and there had come
to the knowledge of secret things, and so was
at last <i>Am Faidh Chriosd</i>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A great weakness came upon the old woman
when she had spoken thus far. Ynys feared
that she would have breath for no further
word, but after a thin gasping, and a listless
fluttering of weak hands upon the coverlet,
whereon her trembling fingers plucked aimlessly
at the invisible blossoms of death, she
opened her eyes once more and stared in a
dim questioning at her who sat by her bedside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me," whispered Ynys, "tell me,
Marsail, what thought it is that is in your own
mind?"</p>

<p>But already the old woman had begun to
wander, though Ynys did not know this.</p>

<p>"For sure, for sure," she muttered, "<i>Am
Faidh</i> ... <i>Am Faidh</i> ... an' a child will
be born ... an' a king he will be, an' ...
that will be the voice of Domhuill, my husband,
I am hearing ... an' dark it is, an'
the tide comin' in ... an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, sure, the tide came in, and if in that
darkness old Marsail Macrae heard any voice
at all, it was that of Domhuill who years
agone had sunk into the wild seas off the
head of Barra.</p>

<p>An hour later, with tears still in her eyes,
Ynys walked slowly home through the cloudy
night. All she had heard came back to her
with a strange familiarity. Something of this,
at least, she had known before. Some hints
of this mysterious Herdsman had reached her
ears. In some inexplicable way his real or
imaginary presence there upon Rona seemed
a preordained thing for her. All that dreaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
mysticism, which had wrought so much of
beauty and wonder into her girlhood in Brittany,
had expanded into a strange flower of
the imagination&mdash;a flower whose subtle fragrance
affected her inward life. Sometimes
she had wondered if all the tragic vicissitudes
which happened at Kerival, with the strange
and dreamlike life which she and Alan had
led since, had so wrought upon her that the
unreal became real, and the actual merely
phantasmal; for now she felt more than ever
assured that some hidden destiny had controlled
all this disastrous mischance, had led
her and Alan there to that lonely island.</p>

<p>She knew that the wild imaginings of the
islanders had woven the legend of the
Prophet, or at any rate of his message, out of
the loom of the longing and the deep nostalgia
whereon is woven that larger tapestry,
the shadow-thridden life of the island Gael.
Laughter and tears, ordinary hopes and
pleasures, and even joy itself, and bright
gayety, and the swift, spontaneous imagination
of susceptible natures&mdash;all this, of course, is
to be found with the island Gael as with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
fellows elsewhere. But every here and there
are some who have in their minds the inheritance
from the dim past of their race,
and are oppressed as no other people are
oppressed by the gloom of a strife between
spiritual emotion and material facts. It is
the brains of dreamers such as these which
clear the mental life of the community; and
it is in these brains are the mysterious looms
which weave the tragic and sorrowful tapestries
of Celtic thought. It were a madness to
suppose that life in the isles consists of nothing
but sadness or melancholy. It is not so,
or need not be so, for the Gael is a creature
of shadow and shine. But whatever the
people is, the brain of the Gael hears a music
that is sadder than any music there is, and
has for its cloudy sky a gloom that shall not
go, for the end is near, and upon the westernmost
shores of these remote isles, the Voice&mdash;as
has been truly said by one who has beautifully
interpreted his own people&mdash;the Voice
of Celtic Sorrow may be heard crying, "<i>Cha
till, cha till, cha till mi tuille</i>"&mdash;I will return, I
will return, I will return no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Ynys knew all this well; and yet she too
dreamed her Celtic dream&mdash;that, even yet,
there might be redemption for the people.
She did not share the wild hope which
some of the older islanders held, that Christ
himself shall come again to redeem an oppressed
race; but might not another saviour
arise, another redeeming spirit come into the
world? And if so, might not that child of
joy be born out of suffering and sorrow and
crime; and if so, might not that child be born
of her?</p>

<p>With startled eyes she crossed the thyme-set
ledge whereon stood Caisteal-Rhona.
Was it, after all, a message she had received
from him who appeared to her in that lonely
cavern of the sea; was he indeed <i>Am Faidh</i>,
the mysterious Prophet of the isles?</p>

<h3><a name="XIV" id="XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE LAUGHTER OF THE KING</p>


<p>What are dreams but the dust of wayfaring
thoughts? Or whence are they, and what air
is upon their shadowy wings? Do they come
out of the twilight of man's mind; are they
ghosts of exiles from vanished palaces of
the brain; or are they heralds with proclamations
of hidden tidings for the soul that
dreams?</p>

<p>It was a life of dream that Ynys and Alan
lived; but Ynys the more, for, as week after
week went by, the burden of her motherhood
wrought her increasingly. Ever since the
night of Marsail's death, Alan had noticed
that Ynys no longer doubted but that in some
way a special message had come to her, a
special revelation. On the other hand, he
had himself swung back to his former conviction,
that the vision he had seen upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
hillside was, in truth, that of a living man.
From fragments here and there, a phrase, a
revealing word, a hint gleaming through
obscure allusions, he came at last to believe
that some one bearing a close, and even
extraordinary, resemblance to himself lived
upon Rona. Although upon the island itself
he could seldom persuade any one to speak
of the Herdsman, the islanders of Seila and
Borosay became gradually less reticent. He
ascertained this, at least: that their fear and
aversion, when he first came, had been occasioned
by the startling likeness between him
and the mysterious being whom they called
Am Buchaille Bàn. On Borosay, he was told,
the fishermen believed that the <i>aonaran nan
chreag</i>, the recluse of the rocks, as commonly
they spoke of him, was no other than Donnacha
Bàn Carmichael, survived there through
these many years, and long since mad with
his loneliness and because of the burden
of his crime. It was with keen surprise that
Alan learned how many of the fishermen of
Borosay and Berneray, and even of Barra,
had caught a glimpse of the outcast. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
this relative familiarity, indeed, that was at
the root of the fear and aversion which had
met him upon his arrival. Almost from the
moment he had landed in Borosay, the rumor
had spread that he was indeed no other than
Donnacha Bàn, and that he had chosen this
way, now both his father and Alasdair
Carmichael were dead, to return to his own
place. So like was Alan to the outlaw who
had long since disappeared from touch with
his fellow men, that many were convinced
that the two could be no other than one and
the same. What puzzled him hardly less was
the fact that, on the rare occasions when Ynys
had consented to speak of what she had seen,
the man she described bore no resemblance to
himself. From one thing and another, he
came at last to the belief that he had really
seen Donnacha Bàn, his cousin; but that
the vision of Ynys's mind was born of her
imagination, stimulated by all the tragedy
and strange vicissitudes she had known, and
wrought by the fantastic tales of Marsail and
Morag MacNeill.</p>

<p>By this time, too, the islanders had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
see that Alan MacAlasdair was certainly not
Donnacha Bàn. Even the startling likeness
no longer betrayed them in this way. The
ministers and the priests laughed at the whole
story and everywhere discouraged the idea
that Donnacha Bàn could still be among the
living. But for the unfortunate superstition
that to meet the Herdsman, whether the lost
soul of Donnacha Bàn or indeed the strange
phantom of the hills of which the old legends
spoke, was to meet inevitable disaster; but
for this, the islanders might have been persuaded
to make such a search among the
caves of Rona as would almost certainly have
revealed the presence of any who dwelt
therein.</p>

<p>But as summer lapsed into autumn, and
autumn itself through its golden silences
waned into the shadow of the equinox, a quiet
happiness came upon both Alan and Ynys.
True, she was still wrought by her strange
visionary life, though of this she said little or
nothing; and, as for himself, he hoped that
with the birth of the child this fantastic
dream life would go. Whoever the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Herdsman was&mdash;if he indeed existed at
all except in the imaginations of those who
spoke of him either as the Buchaille Bàn, or
as the <i>aonaran nan chreag</i>&mdash;Alan believed
that at last he had passed away. None saw
him now: and even Morag MacNeill, who
had often on moonlight nights caught the
sound of a voice chanting among the upper
solitudes, admitted that she now heard nothing
unusual.</p>

<p>St. Martin's summer came at last, and with
it all that wonderful, dreamlike beauty which
bathes the isles in a flood of golden light, and
puts upon sea and land a veil as of ineffable
mystery.</p>

<p>One late afternoon Ynys, returning to
Caisteal-Rhona after an unexplained absence
of several hours, found Alan sitting at a table.
Spread before him were the sheets of one of
the strange old Gaelic tales which he had
ardently begun to translate. She took up the
page which he had just laid down. It was
from the <i>Eachdaireachd Challum mhic cruimein</i>,
and the last words that Alan had translated
were these:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"And when that king had come to the
island, he lived there in the shadow of men's
eyes; for none saw him by day or by night,
and none knew whence he came or whither he
fared; for his feet were shod with silence, and
his way with dusk. But men knew that he
was there, and all feared him. Months, even
years, tramped one on the heels of the other,
and perhaps the king gave no sign, but one
day he would give a sign; and that sign was a
laughing that was heard somewhere, be it
upon the lonely hills, or on the lonely wave, or
in the heart of him who heard. And whenever
the king laughed, he who heard would
fare ere long from his fellows to join that king
in the shadow. But sometimes the king
laughed only because of vain hopes and wild
imaginings, for upon these he lives as well as
upon the strange savors of mortality."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ynys read the page over and over; and
when Alan saw how she brooded upon it, he
regretted that he had left it for her to see.</p>

<p>He the more regretted this when he learned
that that very afternoon she had again been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
among the sea caves. She would not say
what she had seen or heard, if indeed she
had heard or seen any thing unusual. But
that night she woke suddenly, and taking
Alan by the hand, made him promise to go
with her on the morrow to the Teampull-Mhara.</p>

<p>In vain he questioned her as to why she asked
this thing. All she would say was that she
must go there once again, and with him, for
she believed that a spirit out of heaven had
come to reveal to her a wonder. Distressed
by what he knew to be a madness, and fearful
that it might prove to be no passing fantasy,
Alan would fain have persuaded her against
this intention. Even as he spoke, however,
he realized that it might be better to accede
to her wishes, and, above all, to be there
with her, so that it might not be one only who
heard or saw the expected revelation.</p>

<p>And it was a strange faring indeed, that
which occurred on the morrow. At noon,
when the tide was an hour turned in the ebb,
they sailed westward from Caisteal-Rhona.
It was in silence they made that strange journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
together; for, while Alan steered, Ynys
lay down in the hollow of the boat, with her
head against his knees, and he saw that she
slept, or at least lay still with her eyes closed.</p>

<p>When, at last, they passed the headland
and entered the first of the sea arcades, she
rose and sat beside him. Hauling down the
now useless sail, he took an oar and, standing
at the prow, urged the boat inward along the
narrow corridor which led to the huge sea
cave of the Altar.</p>

<p>In the deep gloom&mdash;for even on that day
of golden light and beauty the green air of the
sea cave was heavy with shadow&mdash;there was a
deathly chill. What dull light there was came
from the sheen of the green water which lay
motionless along the black basaltic ledges.
When at last the base of the Altar was reached,
Alan secured the boat by a rope passed
around a projecting spur; and then lay down
in the stern beside Ynys.</p>

<p>"Tell me, dear, what is this thing that you
expect to hear or see?"</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely for a while,
but, though her lips moved, she said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me, dear," he urged again, "who is it
you expect to see or hear?"</p>

<p>"<i>Am Buchaille Bàn</i>," she answered, "the
Herdsman."</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated. Then, taking
her hand in his, and raising it to his lips, he
whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Dearest, all this is a vain dream. There
is no Herdsman upon Rona. If ever there
was a man there who lived solitary&mdash;if ever,
indeed, there was an <i>aonaran nan chreag</i>&mdash;he is
dead long since. What you have seen and
heard has been a preying upon you of wild
thoughts. Think no more of this vision.
We have both suffered too much, and the
knowledge of what is behind us has wrought
upon us too hardly. It is a mistake to be
here, on Rona, now. Ynys, darling, you and
I are young, and we love; let us leave this
melancholy isle&mdash;these melancholy isles&mdash;and
go back into the green, sunny world wherein
we had such joy before; yes, let us even go
back to Kerival; anywhere where we may live
our life with joy and glad content&mdash;but
not here, not in these melancholy, haunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
isles, where our dreams become more real
than our life, and life itself, for us at least,
the mere shadow of being. Ynys, will you
come? Will you go?"</p>

<p>"All shall be as you will, Alan&mdash;<i>afterward</i>.
But first, I must wait here till our child is
born, for I have heard that which is a
message. And one part of that message
concerns you and me; and one concerns
others. And that which concerns you and
me is that in this way, in this child, to be
born here in this place, lies the redemption
of that evil by which your father was slain by
my father. It is not enough that you and
I have forgotten the past; the past remains.
What we cannot do, or no man or woman can
do, the powers that are beyond the grave can
accomplish. Not our love, not even ours,
can redeem that crime. But if, born of us,
one will come, who will be dowered with our
love and free from the blood shadow which
lies upon us, then all will be well and the evil
shall be done with forever more. But also,
has not the Prophet said that one shall be
born upon this island who will redeem his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
oppressed people? And this Prophet, Alan,
I have seen and heard. Never have I seen
his face aright, for it has ever been in the
shadow; but I have heard his voice, for he
has spoken to me, and what he has said is
this: that in the fulness of time the child
I shall bear will be he of whom men have
dreamed in the isles for ages past. Sure,
dear, you and I must be believing that thing,
since he who tells it is no mere erring <i>Faidh</i>,
but himself an immortal spirit."</p>

<p>Alan looked at the speaker in amaze.
There could be no question of her absolute
sincerity; for the beautiful face was lit with
a strange light, and in her eyes was a proud
gleam of conscious sacrifice. That it was all
a madness, a fantasy, he knew well. Long
ago had Lois de Kerival spoken of the
danger that lay for Ynys; she being the inheritor
of a strange brooding spirit which
belonged to her people. Now, in this remote
place, the life of dream and the life of
reality had become one; and Ynys was as
a drifted ship among unknown seas and
mists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>But on one point he believed he might
convince her.</p>

<p>"Why do you speak of the Herdsman as
a spirit, Ynys? What proof have you of this?
If you or I have seen any one at all, be sure
it is a mortal man and no spirit; nay, I know
who it must be, if any one it is, for throughout
the isles men say that Donnacha Bàn,
the son of the brother of my father, was
an outlaw here, and has lived long among
the caves."</p>

<p>"This man," she said quietly, "is not
Donnacha Bàn, but the Prophet of whom the
people speak. He himself has told me this
thing. Yesterday I was here, and he bade
me come again. He spoke out of the shadow
that is about the Altar, though I saw him
not. I asked him if he were Donnacha Bàn,
and he said 'No.' I asked him if he were
<i>Am Faidh</i>, and he said 'Yes.' I asked him
if he were indeed an immortal spirit, and
herald of that which was to be, and he said
'Even so.'"</p>

<p>For a long while after this, no word was
spoken betwixt the twain. The chill of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
remote place began to affect Ynys, and she
shivered slightly at times. But more she
shivered because of the silence which prevailed,
and because that he who had promised
to be there gave no sign. Sure, she thought,
it could not be all a dream; sure, the Herdsman
would come again.</p>

<p>Then, at last, turning to Alan, she said,
"We must come on the morrow; for to-day
he is not here."</p>

<p>"No, dear; never, never shall we come
here again. This is for the last time.
Henceforth, we shall dwell here in Rona no
more."</p>

<p>"You will do this thing for me, Alan, that
I ask?"</p>

<p>"I will do what you ask, Ynys."</p>

<p>"Then take this written word, and leave
it upon the top of the great rock there that
is called the Altar."</p>

<p>With that she placed in his hand a slip of
paper whereon she had already written certain
words. What they were, Alan could not
discern in that shadowy light; but, taking the
slip in his hand, he stepped on the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
ledges at the base of the Altar, and slowly
mounted the precipitous rock.</p>

<p>Ynys watched him till he became himself
a shadow in that darkness. Her heart leaped
when suddenly she heard a cry fall to her out
of the gloom.</p>

<p>"Alan, Alan!" she cried, and a great fear
was upon her when no answer came; but at
last, with passionate relief, she heard him
clambering slowly down the perilous slope of
that obscure place. When he reached the
ledge, he stood still, regarding her.</p>

<p>"Why do you not come into the boat,
Alan?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Dear, I have that to tell you which will
let you see that I spoke truth."</p>

<p>She looked at him with parted lips, her
breath coming and going like that of a caged
bird.</p>

<p>"What is it, Alan?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Ynys, when I reached the top of the
Altar, and in the dim light that was there, I
saw the dead body of a man lying upon the
rock. His head was lain back so that the
gleam from a crevice in the cliff overhead fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
upon it. The man has been dead many
hours. He is a man whose hair has been
grayed by years and sorrow, but the man is
he who is of my blood; he whom I resemble
so closely; he that the fishermen call <i>aonaran
nan chreag</i>; he that is the Herdsman."</p>

<p>Ynys made no reply; still she looked at
him with large, wondering eyes.</p>

<p>"Ynys, darling, do you not understand
what it is that I say? This man, that they
call the Buchaille Bàn&mdash;this man whom you
believe to be the Herdsman of the old legend&mdash;is
no other than Donnacha Bàn, he who
years and years ago slew his brother and has
been an exile ever since on this lonely island.
How could he, then, a man as I am, though
with upon him a worse blood-shadow than
lies upon us&mdash;how could he tell you aught of
what is to be? What message could he give
you that is himself a lost soul?</p>

<p>"Would you be for following a herdsman
who could lead you to no fold? This man is
dead, Ynys; and it is well that you brought
me here to-day. That is a good thing, and
for sure God willed it. Out of this all our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
new happiness may come. For now we know
what is this mysterious shadow that has darkened
our lives ever since we came to Rona.
Now we have knowledge that it was no mere
phantom I saw upon the hillside; and now also
we know that he who told you these strange,
wild things of which you speak was no
prophet with a message from the world of the
spirit, but a man wrought to madness, a man
who for all these years had lived his lonely,
secretive life upon the hills, or among these
caves of the sea. Come, then, dear, and let
us go hence. Sure, at the last, it is well that
we have found this way. Come, Ynys, we
will go now and never come here again."</p>

<p>He looked eagerly for her assenting eyes.
With pain in his heart, however, he saw that
the dream&mdash;the strange, inexplicable fantasy&mdash;had
not yet gone out of them. With a sigh,
he entered the boat and took her hand.</p>

<p>"Let us go," she said, and that was all.</p>

<p>Slowly Alan oared the boat across the
shadowy gulf of the cave, along the narrow
passage which led therefrom, and out into
the pale green gloom of the arched arcade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
wherein the sight and sound of the sea made
a music in his ears.</p>

<p>But the short November day was already
passing to its end. All the sea westward was
aflame with gold and crimson light, and in the
great dome of the sky a wonderful radiance
lifted above the paleness of the clouds whose
pinnacled and bastioned heights towered in
the south-west.</p>

<p>A faint wind blew eastwardly; so, raising
the sail, Alan made it fast and then sat down
beside Ynys. But she, rising, moved along
the boat to the mast, and leaned there with
her face against the setting sun.</p>

<p>Idly they drifted onward. Deep silence
prevailed betwixt them; deep silence was all
about them, save for the endless, inarticulate
murmur of the sea, the splash of low waves
against the rocks of Rona, and the sigh of the
surf at the base of the basalt precipices.</p>

<p>And this was their homeward sailing on
that day of revelation; Ynys, with her back
against the mast, and her face irradiated by
the light of the setting sun; he, steering,
with his face in shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>On a night of rain and amid the rumor of
tempest, three weeks later, Ynys heard the
Laughter of the King, when the child who
was to be the bearer of so fair a destiny lay
by her side, white and chill as the foam
thrown up for a brief while upon the rocks
by the unheeding sea.</p>

<h3><a name="XV" id="XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD</p>


<p>When, once more, the exquisite mystery
of spring came upon the world, there was
a not less wonderful rebirth in the heart of
Ynys.</p>

<p>With the coming of that child upon whom
such high hopes had been set&mdash;its birth, still
and quiet as a snowdrop fallen before an icy
wind upon the snow which nurtured it&mdash;all the
fear of a mysterious Nemesis, because of her
union with Alan despite the shadow of tragic
crime which made that union ominous of evil
destiny; all the vague forebodings which had
possessed her ever since she left Kerival; and,
at the last, all the mystic elation with which
her mind had become a winged and wandering
spirit, passed from her.</p>

<p>The gloom of that northern winter was
tonic to them both. As soon as her weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
was past, and once more she was able to go
about with Alan, her old joyousness returned.
In her eyes it was almost as though the
islanders shared her recovered happiness.
For one thing, they no more avoided her and
Alan. With the death of the man who had
so long sustained a mysterious existence
upon Rona, their superstitious aversion went;
they ceased to speak of <i>Am Buchaille Bàn</i>
and, whether Donnacha Bàn had found on
Rona one of the hidden ways to heaven or
had only dallied upon one of the byways to
hell, it was commonly held that he had paid
his death-eric by his lonely and even appalling
life of unredeemed solitude. Now that there
was no longer any possibility of confusion between
the outcast who had come to his tragic
end, among the sea caves of Rona, and his
kinsman who bore to him so extraordinary a
resemblance, a deep sense of the injustice that
had been done to Alan Carmichael prevailed
among the islanders. In many ways they
showed their regret; but most satisfactorily,
so far as Alan was concerned, by taking him
as one of themselves; as a man no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
under the shadow of doom or in any way
linked to a disastrous fate.</p>

<p>True, there were still some of the isle folk
on Borosay and Barra who maintained that the
man who had been found in the sea cave,
whether Donnacha Bàn or some other, had
nothing to do with the mysterious Herdsman,
whose advent, indeed, had long been anticipated
by a section of the older inhabitants.
It was only seven years since Murdo Macphail&mdash;better
known as Murdo-Bronnach-namhara,
Brown Murdoch of the Sea, from his
habit of preaching to the islanders from where
he stood waist-deep in the water&mdash;had prophesied
that the Herdsman who was Shepherd
of Israel would indeed come again, and that
within seven years. And had he not added
that if the Fair Lonely One were not accepted
of the people, there would be deep sorrow for
one and all, and a bitter wrong upon all the
isles of the west?</p>

<p>These murmurers now shook their heads
and whispered often. Of a truth, they said,
the Herdsman was come as foretold, and Alan
Carmichael was blind indeed not to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Ynys, his wife, had received a vision, and,
because of her silence, been punished in the
death of her first-born.</p>

<p>But with the white growth of winter, the
pleasant, familiar intercourse that everywhere
prevailed wrought finally against the last
threadbare fabric of superstition. Before the
glow of the peats the sadness and gloom slowly
dissipated. It was a new delight to both Alan
and Ynys to find that the islanders could be so
genial and almost gay, with a love of laughter
and music and grotesque humor which, even in
the blithe little fishing haven of Ploumaliou,
they had never seen surpassed.</p>

<p>The cold months passed for them in a quiet
content. That could not be happiness upon
which was the shadow of so much pain; but
there was something akin to it in the sweet
serenity which came like calm after storm.</p>

<p>Possibly they might have been content
to remain in Rona; to find in the island
their interest and happiness. Ynys, indeed,
often longed to leave the place
where she had been so sadly disillusioned;
and yet she did not urge that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
home at Caisteal-Rhona should be broken up.
While they were still in this state of quiet suspense,
news came that affected them strangely.</p>

<p>They had had no word from Kerival since
they left, but one windy March day a boat from
Borosay put into the haven with letters from
Alan's agents in Edinburgh. Among them was
one from the Abbé Cæsar de La Bruyère, from
Kerloek. From this Alan learned strange news.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the very day that he and Ynys had left
Kerival, Annaik had disappeared. None
knew where she had gone. At first it was
thought that Judik Kerbastiou had something
to do with her absence, but two days
after she had gone he was again at Kerival.
The house was a place of anarchy. No
one knew whom to obey; what to do. With
the Marquise Lois in her grave, with both
Ynys and Annaik mysteriously absent and
apparently with no intention to return, and
with Tristran the Silent more morosely taciturn
than his wont, and more than ever
an invalid, with all this it was difficult
for those in authority to exact the habitual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
duties. But in addition to this there were the
imperious claims of Judik Kerbastiou, emphasized
by his refusal to be addressed by any
other name than the Sieur Jud de Kerival.</p>

<p>When, suddenly, and while quietly dictating
a letter, the Marquis Tristran died, it
seemed at last as though Judik's triumph had
come. For a brief while he was even addressed
as M. le Marquis. But on the noon
following that day he had a rude awakening.
A notary from Ploumaliou arrived with
the family lawyers, and produced a written
and signed confession on the part of the
woman whom he had called mother, that he
was not her child at all, that her own child
was dead, and that Kerbastiou was really a
forest foundling. As if this were not enough,
the notary also proved, even to the conviction
of Judik, that the written marriage testimony
from the parish books was an impudent forgery.</p>

<p>So the man who had made so abrupt and
dramatic an appearance on the threshold of
Kerival had, in the very moment of his triumph,
to retreat once more to his obscurity as
a homeless woodlander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>The sole heirs now were Annaik and Ynys,
but of neither was any thing known. The
difficulty was partially solved by the abrupt
appearance of Annaik on the day of the
second conclave.</p>

<p>For a time thereafter all went well at Kerival.
Then rumor began to spread mysterious
whispers about the Lady Annaik. She would
see none of her neighbors, whether from far
or near, and even the Sieur de Morvan and
his kith or kin were denied. Then, too,
she disappeared for days at a time. Some
thought she went to Ploumaliou or Kerloek,
some that she had gone as far away as Rennes
or St. Brieuc, and a few even imagined the
remote Paris to be her goal. None dreamed
that she had gone no further than the forest
of Kerival.</p>

<p>But as the autumn waned, rumors became
more explicit. Strange things were said of
Annaik de Kerival. At last the anxious Curé
of Ploumaliou took it upon himself to assure all
who spoke to him about the Lady of Kerival
that he had good reason to believe she was
privately married. This, at least, drew some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of the poison out of the gossip that had
arisen.</p>

<p>Then a day came when the Lady Annaik
dismissed the servants at Kerival, and left
none in the house save an old gardener and
his wife. She was going away for a time, she
said. She went, and from that day was not
seen again.</p>

<p>Then came, in the Abbé Cæsar de La
Bruyère's letter, the strangest part of the
mystery.</p>

<p>Annaik, ever since the departure of Alan
and Ynys, had been living the forest life. All
her passionate sylvan and barbaric instincts
had been suddenly aroused. For the green
woods and the forest ways she suffered an
intolerable nostalgia. But over and above
this was another reason. It seemed, said the
Abbé Cæsar, that she must have returned the
rude love of Judik Kerbastiou. However this
might be, she lived with him for days at a time,
and he himself had a copy of their marriage certificate
made out at a registrar's in a remote
little hill-town in the Montagnes Noires.</p>

<p>This union with the morose and strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Judik Kerbastiou had not been known to any
of the peasants until her trouble came to her.
When the day was near she did not return to
Kerival, but kept to the gypsy tent which she
shared with Judik. After the birth of the
child, every one knew, and every one marvelled.
It was a madness: that was what all
said, from Kerloek to Ploumaliou.</p>

<p>But neither the union nor the child brought
happiness to these twain, so much at one in
their woodland life, so hopelessly alien in all
else. One day a man named Iouenn Kerbac'h,
passing by the tent where Judik and
Annaik had taken shelter from a violent
thunder-storm, overheard a savage upbraiding
on the part of Kerbastiou. Annaik was his
wife, it was true&mdash;so he cried&mdash;but a wife who
had in nothing short of madness renounced
every thing, and now would claim nothing of
her own nor allow him to claim aught; a wife
whom he loved with another madness, and
yet hated because she was so hopelessly
remote from himself; a wife who had borne
a child, but a child that had nothing of the
gypsy eyes and swarthy darkness of Judik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Kerbastiou, but was fair, and with skin as white
and eyes as blue as those of Alan de Kerival.</p>

<p>It was this, and the terrible words that were
said, which made Iouenn Kerbac'h hurry
onward, dreading to listen further. Yet nothing
that he overheard gave him so strange a
fear as the laugh with which Annaik de Kerival
greeted a savage, screaming threat of
death, hurled at her because of her silence
after the taunting accusation he had made ...
had made, and defied her to refute.</p>

<p>None heard or saw Annaik Kerbastiou after
that day, till the night of the evening when
Judik came into Haut-Kerloek and went
straight to Jehan Rusgol, the Maire.</p>

<p>When asked what he had come for he had
replied simply: "The woman Annaik is
dead." It was commonly thought that he
had killed her, but there was no evidence of
this, and the end of the inevitable legal procedure
was the acquittal of the woodlander.
From that day the man was rarely seen of
his fellows, and even then, for the most part,
only by charcoal-burners and others who had
forest business. A few peasants knew where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
his hut was, and now and again called to
speak with him, or to drink a cup of cider;
but oftener than not he was absent, and
always with the child. The boy had survived
his mother's death, and in some strange way
had suddenly become so dear to Judik Kerbastiou
that the two were inseparable.</p>

<p>This, then, was the tidings which startled
Alan and Ynys out of their remote quiescence.</p>

<p>The unexpected news, coupled with the
urgent request that both should return to
Kerival, if only for a brief while, so as to
prevent the property falling into absolute
ruin, came as a whip upon Alan's mind. To
all he said Ynys agreed, and was even
glad to leave Rona and return to Brittany.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So it was that, with the first days of April,
they bade farewell to Ian and his sister, whom
they left at Caisteal-Rhona, which was henceforth
to be their home, and to all upon the
island, and set forth in a fishing smack for
Borosay.</p>

<p>It was not till the last of the precipices of
Rona was lost to view behind the south headland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
of Borosay that Ynys clearly realized the
deep gladness with which she left the lonely
Isle of the Caves. That it would have been
impossible for her to live there long she was
now well assured; and for Alan, too, the life
was not suitable. For the north, and for the
islands, they would ever have a deep feeling,
almost sacred in its intensity; but all that
had happened made living there a thing difficult
and painful for them, and moreover each,
though Ynys most, missed that green woodland
beauty, the ceaseless forest charm,
which made the very memory of Kerival so
fragrant.</p>

<p>They went away, then, not as travellers who
fare far with no thought of return, but rather
as pilgrims returning homeward from a shrine
sacred to them by profound and intimate
associations.</p>

<p>That was, indeed, for them a strange home-going.
From the first there was something
dreamlike, unreal, about that southward flight;
in the long sail across Hebrid seas, calm as
glass until the south headlands of Mull were
passed, and then storm-swept; in the rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
journey across Scotland and through England;
and in the recrossing of that narrow sea
which had once seemed to them a gulf of
ultimate division.</p>

<p>But when once more they saw the grotesque
bulbous spire of Ploumaliou rising above the
sand-dunes by which, from St. Malo, they
approached the dear, familiar country, all this
uncertainty went from them. With light
hearts they realized it was indeed true; that
they were free at last of a life for which they
were now unfitted, and that the lost threads
in the maze had been found.</p>

<p>By their own wish the home-coming was so
private that none knew of it save the doctor,
the Curé, the lawyer who accompanied them
from Ploumaliou, and the old gardener and
his wife. As they neared the château from
the north, Alan and Ynys alighted from the
dishevelled carriage which was the sole
vehicle of which Ploumaliou could boast.
M. Auriol could drive on alone; for themselves,
they chose to reach their home by the dunes
and scattered pines, and thence by the yew
close behind the manor-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The day was windless and of a serene
beauty. Ever since noon the few clouds, suspensive
in the azure flood like islets of snow,
had waned till they were faint and light as
blown swan's-down, then filmy as vapor lifted
against the sun, and at last were no more
visible; there had been the same unfathomable
depths of azure, through which the tides of
light imperceptibly ebbed from the zenith.
The sea, too, was of a vivid though motionless
blue, save where luminous with a white
sheen or wrought with violet shadows and
straits of amethyst. Upon the land lay
a golden peace. A richer glow involved
the dunes, where the pine-shadows cast
long, motionless blue shapes. As, hand in
hand, Ynys and Alan moved athwart the
pine glade whence they could pass at once
either westward into the cypress alley or eastward
through the yew close, they stopped
instinctively. Beyond them rose the chimneys
and gables of the House of Kerival,
strangely still and remote, for all their familiar
look. What a brief while ago it seemed
since he and she had walked under these pines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
wrought by the first ecstasy of their virginal
love. Then, those who now lay quiet in the
darkness of the earth were alive; Lois de
Kerival, with her repressed, passionate heart
still at last; the Marquis Tristran, with the
young grass growing soft and green over his
bitterness; Alasdair Carmichael, with the
echo of the island waves stilled under the
quiet bells of the little church which guarded
the grave-yard of St. Blaise; and Annaik&mdash;poor
lost waif of beautiful womanhood, submerged
forever in the green woods she loved
so well, and sleeping so sound a sleep at last
in an unmarked hollow beneath an ancient
tree in some obscure glade or alley.</p>

<p>A shadow was in Alan's eyes&mdash;a deeper
shadow than that caused by thought of the
dead who lay heedless and listless, at once so
near and such depths away&mdash;a deeper shadow
than that cast by memory of the crime which
overlay the past.</p>

<p>As his eyes wandered to the cypress alley,
his heart knew again a pain almost beyond
endurance; a pain that only the peace of
Rona had translated into a strong acquiescence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
in the irrevocable past&mdash;a pain become
less haunting under the stress of all
which had happened in connection with the
Herdsman, till it knew a bitter resurrection
when Alan came to read of the tragic fate of
the woman who had loved him.</p>

<p>Through some wayward impulse Ynys
abruptly asked him to go with her through
the cypress alley, so that they should approach
the château from the forest.</p>

<p>Silently, and with downcast eyes, he walked
by her side, his hand still in hers. But his
thoughts were with the dead woman, on the
bitter hazard of love, and on what lay, forever
secret, between Annaik and himself. And as
he communed with himself, in an austere pain
of remembrance, he came to see more and
more clearly that in some strange way the
Herdsman episode, with all involved therein,
was no arbitrary chance in the maze of life,
but a definite working out of destiny. None
could ever know what Annaik had foretold,
had known, on that terrible night when the
silence of the moonlit peace was continuously
rent by the savage screams of the peacocks;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
nor could any other than himself discern,
against the dark tapestries of what veiled
his inner life, the weaving of an inextricable
web.</p>

<p>It was difficult for him to believe that she
was dead&mdash;Annaik, who had always been so
radiantly, superbly alive. Now there was dust
upon that wonderful bronze hair; darkness
upon those lambent eyes; no swift pulse beating
in the red tide in the veins; a frost against
the heart. What a burden it had carried,
poor heart! "Oh, Annaik, Annaik!" he muttered
below his breath, "what a hard wayfaring
because of a passion crucified upon the bitter
tree of despair; what a fierce, silent, unwavering
tyranny over the rebellious voices crying
unceasingly from every nerve, or swept
this way and that on every stormy tide of
blood."</p>

<p>That Annaik who loved the forest so passing
well, and in whom the green fire of life
flamed consumingly, should no longer be alive
to rejoice in the glory of spring, now once
again everywhere involving the brown earth
and the purple branches, was an almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
unrealizable thing. To walk in that cypress
alley once more; to cross that open glade
with its single hawthorn; to move in the dark
green shadow of that yew close; to do this and
remember all that Annaik had suffered, and
that now she lay quiet and beyond all pain or
joy to touch her, was to Alan a thought
almost too poignant to be borne.</p>

<p>It was with an effort he answered Ynys
when she spoke, and it was in silence that
they entered the house which was now their
home, and where&mdash;years ago, as it seemed&mdash;they
had been young and happy.</p>

<p>But that night he sat alone for a time in the
little room in the tower which rose from the
east wing of Kerival&mdash;the room he had fitted
up as an observatory, similar, on a smaller
scale, to that in the Tour de l'Ile where he had
so deeply studied the mystery of the starry
world. Here he had dreamed many dreams,
and here he dreamed yet another.</p>

<p>For out of his thoughts about Annaik and
Ynys arose a fuller, a deeper conception of
Womanhood. How well he remembered a
legend that Ynys had told him on Rona: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
legend of a fair spirit which goes to and fro
upon the world, the Weaver of Tears. He
loves the pathways of sorrow. His voice is
low and sweet, with a sound like the bubbling
of waters in that fount whence the rainbows
rise. His eyes are in quiet places, and in the
dumb pain of animals as in the agony of the
human brain: but most he is found, oftenest
are the dewy traces of his feet, in the heart of
woman.</p>

<p>Tears, tears! They are not the saltest tears
which are on the lids of those who weep.
Fierce tears there are, hot founts of pain in
the mind of many a man, that are never shed,
but slowly crystallize in furrows on brow and
face, and in deep weariness in the eyes; fierce
tears, unquenchable, in the heart of many a
woman, whose brave eyes look fearlessly at
life; whose dauntless courage goes forth daily
to die, but never to be vanquished.</p>

<p>In truth the Weaver of Tears abides in
the heart of Woman. O Mother of Pity, of
Love, of deep Compassion! with thee it is to
yearn forever for the ideal human; to bring
the spiritual love into fusion with human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
desire; endlessly to strive, endlessly to fail;
always to hope in spite of disillusion; to love
unswervingly against all baffling and misunderstanding,
and even forgetfulness! O
Woman, whose eyes are always stretched out
to her erring children, whose heart is big
enough to cover all the little children in the
world, and suffer with their sufferings, and
joy with their joys! Woman, whose other
divine names are Strength and Patience, who
is no girl, no Virgin, because she has drunk
too deeply of the fount of Life to be very
young or very joyful. Upon her lips is the
shadowy kiss of death; in her eyes is the
shadow of birth. She is the veiled interpreter
of the two mysteries. Yet what joyousness like
hers, when she wills; because of her unwavering
hope, her inexhaustible fount of love?</p>

<p>So it was that, just as Alan had long recognized
as a deep truth how the spiritual nature
of man has been revealed to humanity in many
divine incarnations, so he had come to believe
that the spiritual nature of woman has been
revealed in the many Marys, sisters of the
Beloved, who have had the keys of the soul and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the heart in their unconscious keeping. In this
exquisite truth he knew a fresh and vivid
hope. Was it all a dream that Ynys had
dreamed, far away among the sea arcades of
Rona? Had the Herdsman, the Shepherd of
Souls, indeed revealed to her that a child was
to be born who would be one of the redeemers
of the world? A Woman Saviour, who would
come near to all of us, because in her heart
would be the blind tears of the child, and the
bitter tears of the man, and the patient tears
of the woman; who would be the Compassionate
One, with no end or aim but compassion&mdash;with
no doctrine to teach, no way to show,
but only deep, wonderful, beautiful, inalienable,
unquenchable compassion?</p>

<p>For, in truth, there is the divine, eternal
feminine counterpart to the divine, eternal
male, and both are needed to explain the
mystery of the dual Spirit within us&mdash;the
mystery of the Two in One, so infinitely
stranger and more wonderful than that triune
life which the blind teachers of the blind have
made a rock of stumbling and offence out of a
truth clear and obvious as noon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>We speak of Mother Nature, but we do not
discern the living truth behind our words.
How few of us have the vision of this great
brooding Mother, whose garment is the earth
and sea, whose head is pillowed among the
stars; she who, with Death and Sleep as her
familiar shapes, soothes and rests all the
weariness of the world, from the waning leaf
to the beating pulse; from the brief span of
a human heart to the furrowing of granite
brows by the uninterrupted sun, the hounds
of rain and wind, and the untrammelled airs
of heaven.</p>

<p>Not cruel, relentless, impotently anarchic,
chaotically potent, this Mater Genetrix. We
see her thus, who are flying threads in the
loom she weaves. But she is patient, abiding,
certain, inviolate, and silent ever. It is only
when we come to this vision of her whom we
call Isis or Hera or Orchil, or one of a hundred
other names, our unknown Earth-Mother,
that men and women will know each other
aright, and go hand in hand along the road of
Life without striving to crush, to subdue, to
usurp, to retaliate, to separate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, fair vision of humanity to come! man
and woman side by side, sweet, serene, true,
simple, natural, fulfilling Earth's and Heaven's
behests; unashamed, unsophisticated, unaffected,
each to each and for each; children
of one mother, inheritors of a like destiny,
and, at the last, artificers of an equal fate.</p>

<p>Pondering thus, Alan rose and looked out
into the night. In that great stillness, wherein
the moonlight lay like the visible fragrance of
the earth, he gazed long and intently. How
shadowy, now, were these lives that had so
lately palpitated in this very place; how
strange their silence, their incommunicable
knowledge, their fathomless peace!</p>

<p>Was it all lost ... the long endurance of
pain, the pangs of sorrow? If so, what was
the lesson of life? Surely, to live with sweet
serenity and gladness, content against the inevitable
hour. There is solace of a kind in
the idea of a common end, of that terrible
processional march of life wherein the myriad
is momentary, and the immeasurable is but a
passing shadow. But, alas! it is only solace
of a kind; for what heart that has beat to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
pulse of love can relinquish the sweet dream
of life, and what coronal can philosophy put
upon the brows of youth in place of eternity?</p>

<p>No, no! of this he felt sure. In the Beauty
of the World lies the ultimate redemption of
our mortality. When we shall become at one
with nature, in a sense profounder even than
the poetic imaginings of most of us, we shall
understand what now we fail to discern. The
arrogance of those who would have the stars
as candles for our night, and the universe as
a pleasaunce for our thought, will be as impossible
as the blind fatuity of those who say we
are of dust, briefly vitalized, that shall be dust
again, with no fragrance saved from the rude
bankruptcy of life, no beauty raised up against
the sun to bloom anew.</p>

<p>It is no idle dream, this; no idle dream that
we are a perishing clan among the sons of God,
because of this slow waning of our joy, of our
passionate delight in the Beauty of the World.
We have been unable to look out upon the
shining of our star, for the vision overcomes
us; and we have used veils which we call
"scenery," "picturesqueness," and the like&mdash;poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
barren words that are so voiceless and
remote before the rustle of leaves and the lap
of water; before the ancient music of the
wind, and all the sovran eloquence of the
tides of light. But a day may come&mdash;nay,
shall surely come&mdash;when indeed the poor and
the humble shall inherit the earth; they who
have not made a league with temporal evils,
and out of whose heart shall arise the deep
longing, that shall become universal, of the
Renewal of Youth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Often, in the days that followed their return
to Kerival, Alan and Ynys talked of these
hopes and fears. And, gradually, out of the
beauty of the spring, out of the intensity of
the green fire of life which everywhere flamed
in the brown earth, on the hills, in the waters,
in the heart and brain of man, in the whole
living, breathing world, was born of them a new
joy. They were as the prince and princess
of the fairy tales, for whom every thing was
wonderful. Hand in hand they entered into
the kingdom of youth. It was theirs, thenceforth;
and all the joy of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>To live, and love, and be full of a deep joy,
a glad content, a supporting hope! What destiny
among the stars fairer than this?</p>

<p>They would be harbingers of joy. That
was what they said, one to another. They
would be so glad with sweet life that others
would rejoice; out of their strength they
would strengthen, out of their joy they would
gladden, out of their peace they would comfort,
out of their knowledge they would be
compassionate.</p>

<p>Nor was their dream an unfulfilled vision.
As the weeks slipped into months, and the
months lapsed into years, Alan and Ynys
realized all that it is possible for man and
woman to know of happiness. Happiness,
duties, claims held them to Kerival; but
there they lived in fair comradeship with their
fellows, with the green forest, with all that
nature had to give them for their delight
through wind and wave, through shadow and
shine, through changing seasons and the exquisite
hazard of every passing hour.</p>

<p>To them both, too, came the added joy
which they feared had been forfeited at Rona.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
When Ynys felt the child's hands on her
breast, she was as one transformed by a
light out of heaven. Alan, looking at mother
and child, understood, with all his passion for
the intimate wonder and mystery of nature,
the deeper truth in the words of one of the
greatest of men ... "the Souls of the
Living are the Beauty of the World."</p>

<p>That sometimes a shadow fell was inevitable.
None ever so dusked the sun-way of
Alan's mind as when, remote in the forest of
Kerival, he came upon the unkempt figure
of Judik Kerbastiou, often carrying upon his
shoulder a little child whose happy laughter
was sweet to hear, in whose tawny hair was a
light such as had gleamed in Annaik's, and
whose eyes were blue as the north seas and
as Alan's were.</p>

<p>Often, too, Alan, alone in his observatory,
where he was wont to spend much of his
time, knew that strange nostalgia of the mind
for impossible things. Then, wrought for a
while from his vision of green life, and flamed
by another green fire than that born of the
earth, he dreamed his dream. With him, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
peopled solitude of night was a concourse of
confirming voices. He did not dread the
silence of the stars&mdash;the cold remoteness of
the stellar fire.</p>

<p>In that other watch-tower in Paris, where
he had spent the best hours of his youth, he
had loved that nightly watch of the constellations.
Now, as then, in the pulse of the
planets he found assurances which Faith had
not given him. In the vast, majestic order of
that nocturnal march, that diurnal retreat, he
had learned the law of the whirling leaf and
the falling star; of the slow, æon-delayed
comet and of the slower wane of solar fires.
Looking with visionary eyes into that congregation
of stars, he realized, not the littleness
of the human dream but its divine impulsion.
It was only when, after long vigils into the
quietudes of night, he turned his gaze from
the palaces of the unknown, and thought of
the baffled, fretful swarming in the cities of
men, that his soul rose in revolt against the
sublime ineptitude of man's spiritual leaguer
against destiny.</p>

<p>Destiny&mdash;<i>An Dan</i>&mdash;it was a word familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to him since childhood, when first he had
heard it on the lips of old Ian Macdonald.
And once, on the eve of the Feast of Paschal,
when Alan had asked Daniel Darc what was
the word which the stars spelled from zenith
to nadir, the astronomer had turned and
answered simply, "<i>C'est le Destin</i>." But

word opens lofty perspectives, even while it
obscures those paltry vistas which we deem
unending and dignify with vain hopes and
void immortalities.</p>
